# Build the edit-mode editor bundle from web/ into internal/serve/assets.
#
# A PASS-THROUGH, LIKE `just types`. Every esbuild invocation and the probe now
# live in web/package.json's `build` script, and this recipe spells none of
# them. It used to spell all of them, beside an npm `build` script that spelled
# two of them differently — the same two-things-doing-one-job shape this
# codebase keeps deleting from the product, sitting in the build. The drift was
# not theoretical: `npm run build` omitted --charset=utf8 on both calls, never
# built mermaid.js at all, and never ran probe.mjs, so anyone who reached for
# the ecosystem-normal command got a bundle with escaped copy, a stale
# renderer, and 620 unrun checks. Somebody who knows npm runs `npm run build`;
# somebody who knows this repo runs `just assets`; both reach the same code.
#
# npm is DEV-TIME ONLY. The built editor.js, editor.css and mermaid.js are
# COMMITTED, so neither a `go build` nor a release needs node anywhere near
# it. Run this after changing anything under web/, and commit what it writes.
#
# WHY THE SCRIPTS ARE SHAPED THE WAY THEY ARE. package.json is JSON and cannot
# carry a comment, so the reasoning lives here, next to the recipe that runs it:
#
#   · The CSS goes through esbuild too rather than being copied: one tool, and
#     it minifies and reports a syntax error in the stylesheet the same way it
#     does for the script.
#
#   · mermaid is a THIRD output rather than part of editor.js, because it is
#     several megabytes and editor.js is loaded by every document. A page with
#     no diagram in it must not pay for the renderer; the figure NodeView
#     fetches /_galley/mermaid.js on the first mermaid fence and never
#     otherwise.
#
#   · --charset=utf8 is not cosmetic. esbuild defaults to ASCII output and
#     escapes every non-ASCII character in a string literal, so the
#     reviewer-facing copy — which the handoff spec fixes VERBATIM, em dashes
#     and all — reaches the bundle as `nothing pending \u2014 the document is
#     settled`. probe.mjs asserts those sentences are in what the binary
#     embeds, and it cannot assert a string the build has rewritten. Both files
#     are served with `charset=utf-8` already (see EditServer.Handler), so
#     emitting UTF-8 is what the Content-Type has always claimed.
#
#   · probe.mjs is the last step on purpose — it drives the suggestion plugin
#     without a browser AND checks the bundle it just wrote parses.

# Install web/ dependencies ONCE, and be a near-no-op on every call after the
# first. Every web recipe below depends on this instead of spelling its own
# `npm install`. That mattered: the CI job runs seven of these recipes as
# separate steps, and a plain `npm install` re-resolves the 360-package tree
# for ~2.5 minutes EVEN WHEN node_modules is already populated — so seven of
# them was ~15 minutes of the run doing nothing. The guard skips the install
# when node_modules is present (CI caches it keyed on package-lock.json, so a
# lockfile change is a cache miss and this reinstalls); `npm ci` on a cold
# checkout because it is deterministic against the lockfile.

# Regenerate web/wire.d.ts from the Go structs that ARE the wire.
#
# The generator lives in `go test` (internal/serve/wire_test.go) and NOT in a
# node script, which is the whole design: `just verify` is Go-only and always
# runs — in CI, in the pre-push hook, on every machine — so the wire contract
# is checked even by someone who never installs node. That is the property the
# browser gates lacked and the reason four of them went dark for weeks, one of
# them on this exact contract (`pending.suggestions` became
# `pending.instructions` and two gates died reading the old field).

# Typecheck the browser modules that have opted in with `// @ts-check`.
#
# A PASS-THROUGH, DELIBERATELY. The flags live in web/tsconfig.json and the
# command lives in web/package.json's `typecheck` script; this recipe spells
# neither. `just assets` already reimplements web/package.json's own `build`
# script and the two have DRIFTED — the recipe passes --charset=utf8, bundles
# mermaid-entry.js and runs probe.mjs, and the npm script does none of it —
# which is the two-things-doing-one-job shape this codebase keeps deleting from
# the product, sitting in the build. A third instance of it is not how a type
# checker gets added. Somebody who knows npm runs `npm run typecheck`; somebody
# who knows this repo runs `just types`; both reach the same code.
#
# IT IS NOT PART OF `verify`, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. `verify` is Go-only
# by design, runs where node may not exist, and is what the release path
# depends on; adding a node step would make a `go build` machine unable to run
# the project's own gate. The half of this that belongs in `verify` is the wire
# generator above, because a Go test is exactly what `verify` is made of. This
# half joins the pre-push hook and the CI job that already has node — the same

# THE QUALITY STACK web/ DID NOT HAVE, AND THE THREE RECIPES BELOW ARE THE

# Go has had gofmt, go vet and golangci-lint since the first commit and no Go
# file reaches a commit without passing all three. web/ had a type checker as
# of yesterday and NOTHING ELSE: 14,500 lines of browser client and 17,000 of
# harness with no format check and no linter at all. The owner's framing is
# that this half is just as important as the Go one, and an asymmetry that
# large is what that sentence is about.
#
# PASS-THROUGHS, LIKE `types` AND `assets`. The formatter's settings live in
# .prettierrc, the linter's in web/eslint.config.mjs, and both commands live in
# web/package.json. These recipes spell neither. Somebody who knows npm runs
# `npm run lint`; somebody who knows this repo runs `just lint-web`; both reach
# the same code — the same rule the two recipes above this one now follow, and
# the one `assets` spent a phase breaking.
#
# THEY ARE NOT IN `verify`, FOR `types`' REASON. That recipe is Go-only by

# THE CHECK fallow DOES NOT HAVE, AND THE ONE THIS TASK EXISTS FOR.
#
# fallow (`just dead-code`/`dupes`/`complexity` below) walks the import graph
# from web/.fallowrc.json's `entry` list. An entry naming a file that is not
# there is not an error to fallow — it is silently dropped from the count
# `fallow list`/`dead-code` reports, and the analysis runs anyway, over
# whatever roots DID resolve, with no complaint. That is exactly how
# `entry.js` and `mermaid-entry.js` survived the entry.ts/mermaid-entry.ts
# TypeScript rename: fallow was computing reachability from two dead roots
# and reporting the result as if nothing were wrong. Proven by reintroducing
# a bogus entry (`nonexistent-entry.ts`) — `fallow list` reported the SAME
# entry-point count with it present as without, and `fallow dead-code` never
# mentioned it, in human or JSON output, in a passing or a failing run.
#
# So the check is not fallow's to skip: read every path `.fallowrc.json`
# names and fail loudly if one is not a real file. No node needed — this is
# cheap enough, and foundational enough to the other three below, to run with
# nothing but jq.

# COMPLEXITY, COUNTED ON THE METRICS THAT MEAN SOMETHING HERE.
#
# `just complexity` prints fallow's own verdict and exits non-zero whenever
# anything is over threshold — always — so it cannot be a gate. This recipe is
# the gate, and WHAT IT COUNTS took a correction worth writing down.
#
# FALLOW REPORTS 181 FUNCTIONS OVER THRESHOLD AND 167 OF THEM ARE AN ARTIFACT.
# Those 167 exceed on CRAP ALONE, with cyclomatic complexity from 5 to 15,
# median 6. CRAP is `CC^2 * (1-coverage)^3 + CC`, and this repo has no
# TypeScript coverage instrumentation — so fallow computes it at 0% coverage,
# where it collapses to `CC^2 + CC`. At CC 5 that is exactly 30, the threshold.
# So "critical complexity" in that number means "has five or more branches",
# which is an ordinary function, and the 181 is measuring the ABSENCE OF
# COVERAGE DATA rather than complexity.
#
# It also punished the right behaviour: extracting a helper out of a genuinely
# complex function creates a new small function, which at CC>=5 is a new
# finding, so a real improvement moved the number UP (177 -> 178, measured).
# A gate that fails on the refactor it exists to encourage is worse than none.
#
# SO THE BOUND IS 13 — the findings that exceed a COGNITIVE or CYCLOMATIC
# threshold, the ones where the metric is describing the code. It was 16 until
# #143 ("Break up the five accreted functions") took it to 14, and 14 until
# trail.ts `loadedEntry` was deleted as code nothing called; the ratchet was
# lowered both times, because a bound left above the measurement is not a
# bound. The list is short enough to read and `just complexity-ratchet` prints
# it on a red run — today it is trail.ts `apply`/`reanchor`/`settleEntries`/
# `retractReverted`/`placeEmptyBlocks`, schemacheck.mjs `build`/`checkDrift`,
# rail.ts `carryDrafts`, preflight.mjs `armLoop`/`anchor`, keys.ts `onKey`,
# versions.ts `paintChanges`, bar.ts `paintReadout`. No per-function
# inherent/accreted verdict is recorded anywhere in this repo any more (the
# .superpowers/ assessment this comment used to cite is gone), so this does not
# claim a split — what survives #143 is the count.
#
# Thirteen is a CEILING and is said out loud to be one. A fourteenth is a red build, so nothing new arrives
# under cover of the backlog, and the branch that simplifies one lowers the
# number with it. If TypeScript coverage instrumentation ever lands, CRAP
# becomes meaningful and this should be revisited.
# Dead code and duplication, as no-regression ceilings. Both `just dead-code`
# and `just dupes` print fallow's own verdict and exit non-zero whenever there
# is anything at all, so neither can be a gate. These count instead, against
# bounds whose standing findings are named in the scripts themselves. fallow's
# exit status is therefore ignored (`|| true`, since recipes run with pipefail)
# and the script is the verdict: a fallow that crashed hands it no JSON, and
# json.load fails the recipe.

# THE MEASURED BOUNDS (2026-08-22, this branch), EACH NAMED — a number with
# nothing behind it is not a ratchet, it is a mystery. ALL THREE NOW GATE, in the pre-push hook AND in the
# CI job below, alongside `check-entries`. Each sits exactly ON its bound, so
# the next regression is red on the commit that causes it:
#
#   · dead-code-ratchet: 4 findings, bound 4 — 3 unused class members
#     (VersionsPanel.toggle/.showRound, SuggestionUI.restage; all called
#     cross-file, a false positive of fallow's class-member analysis) and 1
#     duplicate export (`BlockRef`, in trail.ts and in the generated wire.d.ts).
#     The unused-EXPORT backlog this started from — 36 issues, 32 of them
#     unused exports — was cleared by narrowing exports, not by deleting code.
#   · dupes-ratchet: 52 clone groups / 137 instances, 3.9% duplication (1778
#     of 45,676 lines), bound 52 — 55 since share.mjs (see dupes-ratchet.py).
#     135 of the 137 instances are the standalone
#     `.mjs` gate harnesses, whose independence is deliberate and was refused a
#     shared module on purpose; the other 2 are one real group in composer.ts.
#     See dupes-ratchet.py for how it got from 33 to 52.
#   · complexity-ratchet: 13 functions over a COGNITIVE or CYCLOMATIC
#     threshold, bound 13 — not fallow's headline 181 of 1786, which is 92% an
#     artifact of having no coverage data (see `complexity-ratchet` above).
#     Worst: trail.ts `apply` (cyc 23, cog 31).
#
# The bounds are considered limits and not backlog sizes, which is what took
# them from a survey to a gate: the sweep that cleared the unused exports and
# #143's break-up of the five accreted functions are what earned the right to
# gate on 4 / 33 / 14 (55 and 13 today). A ratchet stops the number GROWING
# without demanding it shrink; the branch that clears a finding lowers the bound with it, the way
# the five `no-unused-vars` findings became the four `--max-warnings` holds.
# `check-entries` above never needed that argument: it has no backlog and no
# threshold, only "the file is there or it isn't".

# skylos — cross-language dead code / secrets / security, covering what fallow
# above does not: Go, plus Python and everything under web/ that isn't part of
# the TypeScript build graph (this repo's own harness scripts, docs assets).
#
# NOT a devDependency and NOT installed by this recipe, unlike the fallow
# trio above — skylos is a pip/uv tool (`uv tool install skylos`, or
# `pipx install skylos`), and Go coverage additionally needs the native
# `skylos-go` engine on PATH: clone github.com/duriantaco/skylos and
#   cd skylos/engines/go && go build -o skylos-go ./cmd/skylos-go
# then put the binary on PATH (`skylos doctor` confirms with "Go engine
# available"). Investigated because skylos reports Go coverage as
# "incomplete" without it — confirmed buildable with the toolchain already on
# this machine, no missing platform support, so the false answer here is "it
# cannot be done" rather than "it does not matter", and it was fixed rather
# than reported as a dead end.
#
# NOT wired into CI or the pre-push hook, and that IS the "does this add
# anything" conclusion the task asked for: with skylos-go working, Go dead
# code measures at 0 (`unused_functions`/`unused_imports`/`unused_variables`
# all empty) — golangci-lint's default `unused` linter, already gating every
# push in `just verify`, already covers exactly this class for Go, so there is
# no gap here to fill with a second tool. skylos's other Go-side checks
# (`--secrets`, `--danger`) were tried against this tree and returned mostly
# noise on a first look — high-entropy strings inside a vendored, minified
# mermaid.js and a docs/design demo bundle, not real secrets — the same shape
# CLAUDE.md's "six assertions reported ok" entry warns against gating on
# without first proving the check discriminates a real defect, which nobody
# has done for these two. So: installable, wired for manual use below,
# deliberately not a gate. A future task that wants secrets/danger scanning
# gets to start from a proven-working engine instead of re-litigating whether
# skylos-go can be built at all.

# sentence granularity is worth having, and that the rule for going inside a
# sentence is PIECES rather than SIMILARITY — and both are statements about a
# distribution over real revisions of real markdown. A port that reads well and
# counts differently is a different algorithm, so the sweep is how the port is
# believed.
#
# It is NOT part of `verify` and cannot be: it needs a git repository with
# markdown history, which CI does not have and which is not this repository's to
# pin. `internal/diff/corpus_test.go` is what `verify` runs instead — the
# spike's own five cases, carried into testdata, with their counts pinned.
#
#     just sweep                    # this repository's own history
#     just sweep /path/to/a/repo    # somebody else's

# THE TYPESCRIPT GATE, in TypeScript's own tools: tsc for types, prettier for
# format, eslint for lint, fallow for the three ratchets. Go tooling has no
# business here and none of these is reachable from `go test`.
#
# `check-entries` leads because the ratchets analyse from the roots
# `web/.fallowrc.json` names, and a stale entry makes all three compute from
# the wrong place in silence.

# THE BROWSER GATES — a real chromium against a real editor. These are the only
# checks that can see what a reviewer sees, and every other gate in this repo
# is blind to it.
#
# `layers` is deliberately absent: it measures pixels and two of its checks are
# font-dependent, so it stays a local gate run by hand rather than one whose
# red is ambiguous. Run it with `node web/layers.mjs`.
#
# Each run has a server and state folder of its own (web/gateserve.mjs), so a
# gate never meets another's documents or the machine's own galley. They still
# run one at a time, because the timings are chromium's and chromium is
# sensitive to load.
#
# A KNOWN SECOND SPELLING, named rather than hidden: ci.yml runs these same
# gates as separately-NAMED steps, deliberately, so a red check in the PR list
# says which promise broke without anyone opening a log. That is worth the
# duplication, and the duplication is real — a gate added here has to be added
# there too, and vice versa. If a third caller ever appears, collapse them; two
# with a stated reason is the honest shape.
