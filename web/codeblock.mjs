// codeblock.mjs — A CODE BLOCK TAKES A BLOCK-LEVEL INSTRUCTION, AND ONLY FROM
// ITS GRIP.
//
// A fence is read-only to TYPING and stays that way: a range comment writes a
// `highlight` mark and a `code: true` node carries none, so a selection
// touching a fence gets the deny line and no `Add instruction` button. That
// refusal is the thing this gate protects while it proves the capability
// beside it — the gutter grip that files a WHOLE-BLOCK note against the fence's
// own key, which needs no mark anywhere and so was always possible.
//
// The claims every grip shares (visible at rest, in the gutter, pressable,
// displacing nothing) are web/grip.mjs's. What is here is the fence's own:
//
//   THE GRIP IS THERE AT REST — the fence carries the one block grip, in the
//   left gutter beside it, with no hover issued first. It is the same grip
//   every other block carries; the fence is not a second affordance.
//
//   THE RANGE REFUSAL IS INTACT — a selection INSIDE the fence still shows no
//   comment button and still shows the deny line, in suggestions.ts's own
//   sentence (imported, never copied — a hand-typed sentence here goes stale
//   the day the wording changes and the check keeps reporting ok).
//
//   THE GRIP OPENS THE COMPOSER IN BLOCK MODE — the FORM directly, not the
//   bar: the gesture named its scope by being clicked on one block. The head
//   names the block (`on this code block`) and quotes none of it, because a
//   whole-fence note is about the block and not about the first 28
//   characters of a shell command. The reviewer's selection is not touched.
//
//   SEND FILES A BLOCK THREAD — exactly one pending instruction, `anchor:
//   "block"`, `blockKind: "codeBlock"`, `anchorKey` equal to the fence's own
//   key in the server's block list, and a card in the rail carrying that key,
//   labelled with the block, sitting BESIDE the fence rather than parked in the
//   anchorless region at the rail's foot.
//
//   IT ROUND-TRIPS THROUGH THE FILES — the file holds the comment's ID mark,
//   `{>>@comment cb-…<<}`, immediately after the fence and NOT its words; the
//   unsent round, pending.json, holds the words. Both are still there after
//   the server is stopped, and when `galley edit` is opened on the document
//   again the card is back beside the fence with the same words. A thread that
//   lives only in a session is not a thread that survives a round.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just build
//   GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/codeblock.mjs
//
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. It is in `just gates` beside
// the other five, and a step of its own in ci.yml.
