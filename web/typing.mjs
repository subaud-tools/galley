// typing.mjs — WHAT THE REVIEWER TYPES APPLIES, ON A REAL KEYBOARD.
//
// The gate that did not exist, and whose absence is the whole reason Gap 5
// reached a third round — kept, and REPURPOSED, because the contract it
// guards inverted.
//
// Its first life: one defect had three populations — an edit authored through
// Go, a span read from a file, and a mark the reviewer TYPES — and the third
// survived two rounds of fixes because a doc comment claimed the browser
// minted runs and nobody drove an editor to find out it did not. This file was
// written to drive the layer above the plugin: a real chromium, a real
// `galley edit`, a real Backspace keystroke, and the SERVER asked what it made
// of it.
//
// Its second life is the reviewer's-hand contract
// (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-the-reviewers-hand.md): the reviewer's
// edits apply DIRECTLY. A keystroke produces NO ins/del mark, clean text in
// the document, and leaves the pending count alone. The browser-side run
// stamper is gone because the marks it stamped are gone. A gate that can fail
// is kept and pointed at the new truth: every check below that asserts "no
// mark, no card, clean file" ran RED against the tracked-typing build and
// green after the cut.
//
// ITS THIRD LIFE IS THE SAME CONTRACT WITH THE OTHER HALF OF IT REPLACED, and
// this file was DEAD for the whole interval — it died at the first `pending()`
// call with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')`, and a
// gate that throws four checks into a two-hundred-check run reports nothing at
// all about the hundred and ninety-six after it.
//
// WHAT MOVED. `pendingView` was `{suggestions, comments, changes, blocks}` and
// is `{instructions, blocks}` (internal/serve/editmode.go). The agent no
// longer PROPOSES: `galley suggest` and `galley apply` are deleted verbs,
// `/_galley/suggest` is not a route, ins/del marks have no producer, and the
// reviewer no longer accepts or rejects anything. The agent EDITS THE FILE and
// the reviewer FILES INSTRUCTIONS — immutable facts of a round, not a
// conversation, with no reply box and no resolve.
//
// SO THE SENTENCE THIS FILE PINS SURVIVED AND ITS SECOND CLAUSE CHANGED WHOSE
// WORK IT IS ABOUT. "A keystroke produces no mark, clean text in the file, and
// no change to the pending count" is still the contract; `pending` used to
// count THE AGENT'S PROPOSALS and now counts THE REVIEWER'S OWN INSTRUCTIONS,
// and the claim is the same claim either way, because it was never about who
// owned the other population — it was about the reviewer's KEYSTROKES being in
// neither. Typing is not an instruction any more than it was a proposal. Every
// `pending()` read below moved from `.suggestions` to `.instructions` and no
// check changed its meaning in the move.
//
// WHAT WAS DELETED RATHER THAN TRANSLATED, said here and again at each site,
// because a gate that keeps its count by inventing an equivalent reports
// safety it does not provide:
//
//   §3 IN WHOLE — "a reviewer edit across an agent mark is a verdict by hand".
//   It POSTed an agent proposal to `/_galley/suggest`, watched it land pending
//   and server-stamped, deleted across its ins mark, and asserted the proposal
//   vanished, the sidecar stayed coherent, and the trail entry named WHOSE
//   text the hand had landed on. Every noun in that paragraph is gone: the
//   route, the verb, the mark, the pending proposal, the sidecar's
//   `suggestions` metas. There is no reviewer verdict by hand because there is
//   nothing left to have a verdict about. Nine checks.
//
//   EVERY `trailChanges` READ — the trail as the SERVER holds it. The server
//   holds no trail: `pendingView` carries no `changes` and there is no
//   `/_galley/trail` route to POST one to. The browser's trail plugin is
//   entirely alive — ghosts, highlights, retraction, the set-assignment
//   re-anchor — so each of those checks is restated against `trailEntries()`,
//   THE PLUGIN'S OWN LIST, which carries the fields they read (`old`, `new`,
//   `placed`, `before`, `after`, `anchored`). The CLAIM about the trail's
//   recording is kept exactly; the claim that it REACHED THE SERVER is
//   deleted, because it does not. `proposal` is gone from the entry, and the
//   two checks that read it went with §3.
//
//   §8'S `.gly-revise-trail` CLAUSE — "and it is counted in what the press
//   will tell the agent". That element does not exist: the primary reads
//   `Revise · N` off the INSTRUCTION count now (see web/rounds-ux.mjs), and
//   the trail is counted on nothing. One check.
//
// A FINDING THIS REPAIR TURNED UP, NOTED HERE UNTIL IT WAS FIXED AND LEFT
// SINCE AS A RECORD OF WHAT THE FIX WAS: `App.syncTrail` used to POST the
// trail to `/_galley/trail` on every 600ms debounce, and every one of those
// 404ed — there was no route, the reviewer's record of their own edits was
// browser-local, and it died with the tab regardless. `adoptTrail`,
// `applyServerTrail`, `readoptTrail`, `scheduleTrailSync` and `syncTrail`
// are now DELETED from entry.ts (see the note where they were) rather than
// pointed at a real route: the trail is an outgoing message to the agent,
// not a history, so there is nothing here for a server copy to be FOR.
//
// WHY IT IS ITS OWN GATE. motion.mjs measures rects across a click and
// layers.mjs reads computed style; neither types, and both have charters this
// check does not belong to. Like them it is NOT part of `verify` — it needs a
// chromium and a live server, neither of which CI has.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just build
//   GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/typing.mjs
//
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. There is no `just typing`
// any more — the justfile keeps a target for `rounds-ux` alone — so it is
// spelled out here rather than pointed at a recipe that is not there.

// THE FIXTURE'S POINT IS STILL THE BOLD WORD IN THE MIDDLE. "The retryBudget
// value controls" is three inlines, because a bold run is its own inline — the
// shape that used to split one tracked strike into three cards. Under the new
// contract it earns its keep the other way: a direct deletion across a
// formatting boundary must remove all three inlines cleanly, leave no del
// mark on any of them, and put nothing in /_galley/pending.
//
// The third paragraph was where the AGENT proposed — insert_after over "names
// the dialer" — so a reviewer deletion could span an agent's pending
// insertion: the verdict by hand. THAT WHOLE GESTURE IS GONE (see §3's
// headstone), and the paragraph is KEPT UNTOUCHED rather than removed with it,
// because §7 needs prose nothing has struck to open a composer over and the
// empty-block counts §6, §8 and §9 turn on are stated against a document of a
// known shape. Removing a paragraph to tidy up a deleted section is how a
// fixture quietly stops being able to fail.
//
// THE FOURTH PARAGRAPH IS THE ONE REFUSAL THAT SURVIVES THE CUT. Inline
// `code` is literal text and stays read-only in the editor; the refusal is
// only visible from a keyboard, which is why it stays here rather than in
// probe.mjs alone. `maxRetries` is deliberately a different word from
// `retryBudget`: the selector below finds a phrase by searching text, and two
// paragraphs holding the same word would make every selection ambiguous.
//
// THE LAST PARAGRAPH IS §6'S, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE THE REVIEWER LEAVES
// EMPTY AND WALKS AWAY FROM. Every other deletion above leaves text standing
// in its block, so its trail entry keeps a prefix or a suffix to be re-found
// by; this one empties its block and therefore has NO text on either side,
// which is the exact shape the re-anchor could not place. It is last so that
// nothing earlier can consume it.
//
// THE EMPTY FENCE IS AN EMPTY TEXTBLOCK AT REST, AND THE REVIEWER'S HAND
// CANNOT HAVE MADE IT ONE. A code block is a textblock like any other, and one
// with nothing between its fences carries `content.size === 0` from the moment
// the file is opened — before anybody has typed. The first re-anchor rung for
// a block-emptying deletion counted EVERY empty textblock in the document, so
// this one fence is enough to make §6's ghost refuse: two empties, ambiguity,
// adrift, and Court's original bug back unchanged in a document nobody would
// call unusual. It is also unreachable to the reviewer twice over — the
// transaction filter refuses every edit inside a fence — so counting it can
// only ever produce a false refusal or a wrong anchor.
//
// THE TABLE IS HERE FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON, AND WHAT IT SAID BEFORE WAS
// MEASURED, TRUE OF THE OBSERVABLE IT LOOKED AT, AND WRONG.
//
// It used to read: a blank cell does NOT reach the browser as an empty
// paragraph, because `markdown.tableRow` gave an empty cell no child at all
// and a `tableCell` with empty content does not satisfy TipTap's `block+`, so
// y-prosemirror drops the cell — "the projected .md still reads
// `| timeout | |`, so the file is intact and the loss is the editor's
// rendering only". Every word of that was observed. The conclusion was false,
// and THE FIXTURE IS WHY: its one blank cell was in the LAST COLUMN, and
// `markdown.cellTexts` pads a short row at the END. A row that came back one
// cell short was re-padded into the same bytes it started as, so the file
// really was intact — for that cell, and for no other. Move the blank cell
// one column left and `| timeout | | tail |` is written back as
// `| timeout | tail | |`: every value after the blank slides one column, in
// the author's file, from opening the document and touching nothing.
//
// So the table now carries a blank cell in the FIRST, MIDDLE and LAST column
// and a wholly blank row, and §0 reads the file back. A fixture with only the
// last-column case PASSES AGAINST THE BUG, which is what it did.
//
// A blank cell IS an empty paragraph now (internal/markdown/parse.go gives
// every cell a block, which is the fix), so the table contributes six at-rest
// empty textblocks the reviewer's hand could not have made. That is not a
// problem for §6 and §8, it is the population their exclusion was written
// for: `trail.ts`'s `reviewerBlocks` prunes a table WHOLE. The checks below
// pin both halves — the cells are empty, and exactly one empty block outside
// a table is the one the ladder may search.
//
// §9'S THREE ARE A RUN AND THE LAST TWO OF THEM ARE ADJACENT ON PURPOSE. FOOT,
// then the fox, then §6's block, in that order and at the document's END. §6's
// block is the LAST block in the file, so it has no block after it at all;
// strike the fox above it — which is already empty by then — and the fox's own
// entry records an EMPTY block after it. Those are two different facts and the
// evidence used to spell them the same way (''), so closing the gap handed the
// fox's ghost to §6's block, beside the ghost §6's block had honestly earned.
// FOOT exists because the block above the fox would otherwise be the empty
// FENCE, and Backspace against a fence is an edit the transaction filter
// refuses — the gap would never close and the gesture would prove nothing.
//
// §8'S TWO PARAGRAPHS ARE A PAIR AND THEIR ORDER IS THE TEST. `JOINS` is the
// block the emptied one closes up INTO; `CLOSED` is the one struck whole and
// then closed. They sit far from §6's block on purpose: the joined-away block
// and §6's block must not end up with the SAME neighbours, or a check written
// to prove an entry cannot be anchored onto a stranger's block would be
// proving that two blocks in the same place look alike.

//
// THE ONLY SECTION HERE THAT PRESSES NO KEY, AND IT BELONGS IN THE TYPING GATE
// FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON. Every other check in this file asks what ONE
// keystroke did; this one asks what NO keystroke did, and it is the same
// question with the same answer surface — a real chromium, a real
// `galley edit`, and the author's own file read back off the disk. It runs
// FIRST, before the click above has been followed by anything, because after
// §1 there is a keystroke to blame and the claim is gone.
//
// THE BUG, MEASURED. `internal/markdown/parse.go` gave a blank cell NO child.
// TipTap's `tableCell` is `content: 'block+'`, which an empty fragment does
// not satisfy, and y-prosemirror's `createNodeFromYElement` catches
// `schema.node`'s throw and DELETES the element from the Y doc. The deletion
// is broadcast, `EditServer`'s `doc.OnUpdate` fires, `touch()` schedules
// `Project()`, and `markdown.cellTexts` — which reads cells POSITIONALLY and
// pads at the END — writes the shortened row back with every value after the
// blank one column to the left. Against the pre-fix build, in this exact
// shape:
//
//     file:   | timeout |      | tail |
//     editor: ["timeout", "tail"]
//     file:   | timeout | tail |      |

// wholly blank row came back byte-identical — which is why nobody saw it for
// a whole phase, and why the fixture above carries all four.

// document, touch nothing, the bytes are the bytes. The EDITOR claim is the
// mechanism, and it is what stops the file claim being vacuous — a build that
// simply never projected would satisfy "the file did not change" while the
// reviewer stared at a table with a column missing.

// --- §6 A GHOST SURVIVES THE SERVER REBUILDING THE DOCUMENT UNDER IT -------
//
// COURT'S SECOND FINDING, FROM A LIVE SESSION. Delete a paragraph by hand —
// the red ghost renders, `△ 1 changed` — then file a comment. The comment
// POSTs, the server REBUILDS THE WHOLE DOCUMENT and broadcasts it (CLAUDE.md:
// every server-side mutation does), and the ghost was gone from the page
// afterwards while the entry itself survived in `/_galley/pending` and in the
// sidecar, still holding the deleted text. A re-anchoring defect, not data
// loss — the record was intact and only its PLACE was lost.
//
// WHY IT COULD ONLY EVER HAPPEN TO A DELETION THAT EMPTIED ITS BLOCK. After a
// ySync whole-document replacement an entry's live positions are meaningless,
// so it re-anchors from context — and every rung of that ladder searches the
// document for TEXT (`prefix + new + suffix`). A deletion has no `new` by
// definition, and `contextOf` clamps context to the entry's own textblock,
// which THIS deletion emptied, so both affixes are '' and the needle is the
// empty string. No text, no match, adrift. It runs after the file check above
// on purpose: filing a range comment writes a `{==…==}` highlight into the
// .md, and that check's claim is that nothing SO FAR put CriticMarkup there.
//
// It is driven by a POST rather than by the composer, and the separation is
// deliberate: §7 fixes the composer's Enter, and a §6 that filed its comment
// through a broken Enter would rebuild nothing, find its ghost exactly where
// it left it, and report `ok` for the bug it was written to catch.
//
// RED AGAINST THE TRACKED BUILD: the ghost check fails, the adrift check
// fails (the entry moves into the log-only region), and the server keeps
// reporting the change throughout — which is the point, and why the change is
// asserted on both sides rather than only after.

// happens to be lying about? Spec decision 3 is "refuses rather than

// merely disappointing: the reviewer reads a deletion where none happened.
//
// THE GESTURE IS ORDINARY, WHICH IS WHY IT IS THIS ONE. Strike a line whole,

// removes a paragraph. That second press is a cross-block join, so `recordOf`
// declines it (a join is not a text edit) and no entry records it; the

// --- §9b TWO DELETIONS ARE TWO GHOSTS, AND NEITHER IS THE OTHER'S ---------
//
// COURT'S THIRD FINDING, AND THE FOURTH SHAPE OF ONE BUG. §6 gave a
// block-emptying deletion a rung of its own, §8 made that rung ask for
// evidence, §9 made the evidence three-valued — and every one of those asks
// about ONE entry. Two of them against two empty blocks is not that question
// twice: it is an ASSIGNMENT, and the trail's own order is a fact about the
// SET that no per-entry rung can see. This section is the gesture that shows
// it, on a real keyboard, across a real server-side mutation.
//
// WHY THE REPEATED LINE. §9's three-valued evidence already tells an ADJACENT
// pair apart — the upper records "an empty block below" and the lower "an
// empty block above" — so two paragraphs struck in ordinary prose survive a
// rebuild on the build this section was written against, and a fixture built
// from one would report `ok` for a bug it never reached. TWIN is what closes
// that: three identical lines, two strikes between them, and both entries
// carry the same text on both sides. Measured before the set rule: both
// ghosts gone on the first mutation, both entries in the log-only region.
//
// AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE REFUSAL, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS MORE. §8
// asks what happens when an entry's own block is joined away and some OTHER
// empty block is lying about; this asks the same thing when that other block
// is one ANOTHER ENTRY IS STANDING ON. Measured before the set rule: the
// closed-up entry's stale evidence matched the surviving entry's block
// exactly, and its ghost was drawn there — TWO GHOSTS ON ONE BLOCK, the
// reviewer reading two deletions on a line that lost one. That is the
// wrong-anchor failure spec decision 3 forbids, reached from a direction no
// amount of per-entry evidence can close: a block is only taken from the other
// entry's point of view.
//
// RED AGAINST THE BUILD THIS SECTION SHIPPED WITH, in both halves: the two
// ghosts vanish on the mutation, and — with that fixed and nothing else — the
// closed-up entry's ghost lands on its neighbour's block.

//
// LAST, because it ends the review — and it is now genuinely last, after §6-§9
// rather than after §5c, which makes it a STRONGER claim than it was on its own
// branch: the page it seals is carrying §6's surviving ghost and the log-only
// rows §8 and §9 left, so every claim below is made against a trail that
// actually holds something. On dev alone every decoration it reads was already
// absent by §5c's undo, and each check would have passed on an empty page.
// That ordering is what turned "the verdict retired the trail" from a green
// check into the regression recorded at its site.
//
// This is the gate that made the seal worth building. The failure it exists to
// remove is not a rendering bug: after Approve the server kept serving, the
// page kept taking keystrokes, and the registry entry was already withdrawn —
// so the reviewer typed into a document that could never send, and found out
// by finding out. Every other check here proves that a keystroke DOES
// something; this one proves that after a verdict it does not.
//
// A REAL KEYBOARD, for this file's own reason: `setEditable(false)` is a claim
// about a flag, and the claim under test is about what happens when someone
// types. The whole population beneath it — the plugin, the trail recorder, the
// debounced save, the projection — is exercised by pressing keys and by nothing

  //
  // THE MECHANISM, READ OFF THE PRODUCT. `App.clearTrail` is the browser's
  // half and it is called from exactly one place — the 204 coming back from
  // THIS PAGE'S OWN approving press. Every other route to a verdict reached it
  // through the EPOCH: the server bumped `trailEpoch` in the same act that
  // wiped its copy, `adoptTrail` compared it on the next ordinary pending
  // poll, and a mismatch made the server's list REPLACE this page's. The
  // server publishes no `trailEpoch` and keeps no copy — `pendingView` is
  // `{instructions, blocks}` — so a verdict taken anywhere but in this tab
  // never reaches this tab's trail at all. §10 approves through `POST
  // /_galley/revise`, which is a second tab, a `galley` verb, or an
  // `--on-revise` command, and is the ordinary case rather than an exotic one.
  //
  // IT IS PRINTED AND NOT ASSERTED, which is this codebase's stated answer for
  // a surface that genuinely cannot make its claim: a permanently-red check
  // over a known gap trains people to ignore the gate. Fixing it is a server
  // change (republish the epoch, or retire the trail on the seal the page
  // already adopts) and belongs to whoever owns the trail's second life, not
  // to the repair that made this file run again. When it is fixed, this note
  // becomes the check it was.
