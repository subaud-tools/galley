// arrivals.ts — what changed while the reviewer was reading, as arithmetic.
//
// THE STRIP'S WHOLE JOB IS TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT
// IT. The caret and the scroll never move on their own; an arrival is
// announced, never navigated to, and only a `show me` click scrolls. That is
// the entire difference between a co-author and an interruption.
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM or the network, for the same reason nothing in
// tabs.ts does: the decisions are over plain values, probe.mjs drives every one
// of them with no browser, and the DOM half in entry.ts only renders what it is
// told and starts the fade.

// NOTHING HERE ASKS `decidable` ANY MORE, and the absence is worth a line.
// `batchRows` lived in this file and was the browser's one reader of the
// server's decidability answer that had no rule at all — it paired a
// revision's runs against the whole pending list with no kind filter, and a
// comment's run went into POST /_galley/accept. That is why
// `suggest.Kind.Decidable` is carried onto the wire and why `tabs.ts` exports
// `decidable` to read it. The card `batchRows` fed is deleted, so this module
// no longer offers a verdict about anything — it announces, and announcing is
// not offering. `decidable` is untouched and still governs every surface that
// does offer one; see tabs.ts.

// The reviewer's own author name. Nothing of theirs is tracked any more (the
// reviewer's-hand cut), so in practice every pending suggestion is the
// agent's — but the filter stays: announcing anything of the reviewer's back
// to them would be the editor telling them what they just did.

// How long the strip stays before it fades. THE STRIP IS NOT THE RECORD — the
