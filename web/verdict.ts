// verdict.ts — the verdict: what it is, and the controls that set it.
//
// A REVIEW HAS ONE QUESTION ON OFFER AT A TIME. The top half of this file is
// the pure vocabulary for asking and answering it — markup pending means the
// verdict on offer is Revise, a clean document means it is Approve, a sealed
// review's verdict is one of three fixed outcomes — every label, every button
// string and every enum value that says which of those states is true, with
// no `this` and no DOM. probe.mjs imports it from here directly: a
// browserless test can drive vocabulary.
//
// THE BOTTOM HALF, `verdictMethods`, IS A MIXIN — an object of methods
// `Object.assign`ed onto `App.prototype` in entry.ts, not a class of its own
// — and it is the primary button itself: the label vocabulary above painted
// into `#gly-revise`, the menu the press discloses when work is pending
// (Revise, or Revise & Approve), the poll response that drives all three
// (readRevise — which also drives History's and the seal's own readers, see
// its own comment), and hold/release, the browser-side queue over what the
// rail shows while the mode is live. One file owns one subject — the
// verdict, what it is and the controls that set it — rather than splitting
// the noun from the verb.
//
// `this` IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own
// header for the this-typing decision.
//
// SEVERAL FIELDS THE PRESS BUILDS (`reviseIdle`, `reviseBusy`, `reviseSecs`,
// `reviseApprove`, `reviseCount`, `reviseBack`) ARE OPTIONAL ON `AppShell`,
// AND THAT IS NOT DEFENSIVE TYPING. `makeRevise` sets every one of them only
// inside the branch where `#gly-revise` exists in the DOM (an unbuilt
// checkout has no such element, and the early `return null` skips the whole
// block) — entry.ts's constructor calls `this.revise = this.makeRevise()`
// directly, but nothing in the constructor assigns `reviseIdle` and its
// siblings UNCONDITIONALLY the way appshell.ts's split asks: only the
// element that gates the branch (`revise` itself) is a real `AppState`
// field, and the labels built alongside it are not. In practice all six are
// set together or none of them are, so a caller that has already checked
// `this.revise` never actually finds `this.reviseIdle` missing — but tsc
// cannot see that correlation across two different fields, so `paintRevise`
// and `postVerdict` below narrow each one with a real (and, given the
// invariant above, always inert) local check rather than asserting it away.
// The alternative — typing them required — would be exactly blurDismiss's
// mistake in the other direction: a claim `strictPropertyInitialization`
// would refuse at Task 8.

/** The idle label, and the two halves the counting one is built from.
 *
 * Split because the counting label is assembled from three DOM nodes rather
 * than written as one string — the seconds need their own box to reserve, or
 * the button changes width on every decade of the counter and drags the whole
 * right-hand end of the bar with it (see makeRevise).
 *
 * A BUTTON NAMES ITS OWN PRESS, AND THIS PRESS OPENS A MENU. The label was
 * `Revise` and the menu it opened led with `→ Revise`, so a reviewer who wanted
 * to revise pressed the same word twice — and, far worse in the other
 * direction, a reviewer who wanted to APPROVE was looking at a button that said
 * Revise and would not press it. The title carried the real meaning
 * ("…or accept everything and approve — the press offers both") and a title is
 * not a label: it appears on hover, after a second or two, and never on touch.
 *
 * `Finish ▾` names the ACT OF ENDING, which is what both of the menu's exits
 * are, and the ▾ says a menu is what the press produces. The DIRECT face is
 * untouched: on a clean document the press posts the approve and the button
 * says `Approve`, because there is nothing to choose between (see askRevise,
 * and verdictLabel, which is what refuses to offer Approve while anything is
 * outstanding).
 *
 * THE MENU NAMES THE ENDINGS THAT ARE REACHABLE FROM THE PAGE, and there are
 * two of them. The third ending the seal can render — a discard, `galley
 * discard`'s verdict — has no control anywhere in the browser; that is audit
 * finding #10, it is a product decision about whether the page is the yes-only
 * surface, and it is Court's. When it lands it is one more item in this menu
 * and this label does not change, which is the point of naming the act rather
