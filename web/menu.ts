// web/menu.ts owns the right-click menu in the document.
//
// WHY THERE IS A MENU AT ALL, AND WHY IT IS NOT A POPUP WITH ONE THING IN IT.
// Capture left the rail (see the rail's own header — the rail holds live work
// only, and a `+ add` button needs nothing and is beside nothing). It went two
// places: a control in the bar, where every other document-level action already
// lives, and here. `contextmenu` was UNCLAIMED — no handler existed anywhere in
// web/ — so the gesture cost nothing to take, and the user asked for more items on
// it later. A one-item popup would have to be thrown away to grow; a list of
// `MenuItem`s does not, so this is built as a real menu on the first item.
//
// THE HAZARD IT IS BUILT AGAINST, STATED BEFORE IT IS DISCOVERED AGAIN.
// The menu is `position: absolute` on `document.body` and MUST NEVER be a child
// of `.ProseMirror`. A throwaway surface appended inside the editable subtree
// was parsed as prose and written to the author's file: a fixture went from 1
// pending suggestion to 81 and the `.md` gained the card's text, its placeholder
// and both verb labels as paragraphs. Everything that floats over this document
// — the composer, the refusal note, this — lives on `body` for that one reason.
//
// AND IT HANGS OFF THE BAR'S MEASURED HEIGHT. `openMenu` takes a `frame`
// (App.chromeFrame — the band of the window the prose is readable in, measured
// per call) and clamps into it. A constant here would be wrong the first time
// the bar folds, which is the defect `--gly-bar-h` exists to have stopped.
//
// It draws nothing that DISPLACES: absolute on body, one write of `top`/`left`,
// no transition. Opening the menu moves nothing that was not clicked.
