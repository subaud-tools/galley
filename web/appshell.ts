// appshell.ts — what `this` must be, inside every mixin `Object.assign`ed
// onto `App.prototype`.
//
// A mixin's methods read and write `this` on the live App instance —
// `this.rail`, `this.suggestions`, `this.paintCensus` — and `this` on a plain
// object literal has no type of its own to infer from. THIS FILE IS THAT
// TYPE, spelled once so every mixin task after this one (three more are
// coming, covering roughly twenty more modules) inherits the same answer
// rather than each inventing its own.
//
// THREE SHAPES WERE WEIGHED. TWO ARE ON RECORD AS REJECTED.
//
// PER-MIXIN INTERFACES — each mixin declaring exactly the members its own
// methods touch — were the most honest shape on paper: a mixin's own
// interface IS its documented surface, and reaching for a member the
// interface does not list is a type error naming the overreach on sight.
// REJECTED, because the mixins do not, in fact, keep to disjoint surfaces —
// web/history.ts's own header says so in words ("mixins all land on one
// shared prototype... ordinary, not a boundary violation") and its own
// `paintVersionsButton`, writing `this.bar.versions` — a field web/sheet.ts
// owns — is that header's worked example. Four mixins converted TODAY
// already share `this.cards`, `this.rail`, `this.editor`, `this.sheetCards`,
// `this.sheetOpen`, `this.versionsPanel`, `this.closeSheet`,
// `this.paintSurfaces` and `this.step`. Twenty-one further mixin files
// declaring their own copies of that same core is the "two spellings of one
// rule" shape this codebase has already paid for a dozen times over (see
// CLAUDE.md's "six agreeing spellings and one silence" and everything that
// followed it) — except here it would be TWENTY spellings, each one a place
// a shared field's type could quietly drift from the others.
//
// `ThisType<>` ON THE OBJECT LITERAL is the idiomatic TypeScript spelling of
// exactly this pattern, and it was rejected for what happens at the OTHER
// end of it — Task 8, where `entry.js` becomes `entry.ts` and `App` becomes a
// real class. `ThisType<AppShell>` makes every method in an object literal
// see `this: AppShell` WITHOUT a per-method annotation, which means nothing
// at the call site records that a method needs it, and nothing forces
// `class App` to PROVE it actually satisfies AppShell — there is no
// expression anywhere for that proof to attach to. `this: AppShell` written
// as an explicit first parameter on every method is the identical constraint
// on the identical body, and it costs one line per method — but it appears
// in the function's own signature, which is a real position TypeScript can
// check the moment `App` is a typed class: `Object.assign(App.prototype,
// keyMethods)` becomes a call TypeScript can refuse, and `class App
// implements AppShell` becomes a sentence TypeScript can verify. That
// verification is the entire point of doing this now rather than leaving
// every mixin's assumption about `this` implicit until Task 8 has to
// reconstruct it from twenty-five files at once.
//
// SO: ONE SHARED INTERFACE, and every mixin method spells `this: AppShell`
// as its first parameter — in this file, and in every mixin file after it.
// It is not a claim that App has ONLY these members; App will have hundreds,
// most of them private to a single not-yet-converted mixin. It is a claim
// that THESE are the ones a method converted so far may touch, checked on
// every one of them, every time this file or a caller of it changes.
//
// GOD-INTERFACE IS A REAL RISK, AND IT IS ACCEPTED RATHER THAN DESIGNED
// AROUND. As the three remaining mixin tasks land, this file's member count
// will keep growing toward App's own. That is the honest shape of a codebase
// whose mixins already share one prototype by design — an interface kept
// artificially small by inventing boundaries the mixins themselves do not
// observe would be documenting a discipline the code does not practise, and
// would be wrong in the direction that costs the most: a member silently
// missing from AppShell that some OTHER mixin still needs is exactly the
// wrong assumption this file exists to make loud. What stays narrow is each
// method's OWN reach — `this: AppShell` reads the same on `sectionFor` as on
// `paintSheet`, and that is the cost of the shared shape.
//
// AT TASK 8, AND THIS WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED. An earlier draft of
// this header said `class App implements AppShell` would become a sentence
// TypeScript can verify. IT WOULD NOT: 34 of these members arrive through
// `Object.assign(App.prototype, …)`, so no class body declares them, and the
// clause reports "Property 'paintCensus' is missing in type 'App'" once per
// method. The obvious repair — declaration merging, `interface App extends
// AppShell {}` — compiles, and verifies NOTHING: a required member simply
// absent from the class still type-checks at every use and is `undefined` at
// runtime. Both were run against this repo's own tsc before this was written.
//
// So the interface is SPLIT along the only line that matters here — what the
// class body itself declares, against what is bolted on afterwards:
//
//   `class App implements AppState`   — REAL verification. Every field below
//                                       is one App's own constructor assigns,
//                                       so the clause can and does check it.
//   `interface App extends AppMethods {}` — a DECLARATION, not a check, and
//                                       necessarily so: these genuinely do
//                                       not exist until Object.assign runs.
//
// `AppShell` is the two together and stays what every mixin method's `this`
// is annotated as, so nothing in the six converted mixins changes. What the
// split buys is that the half which CAN be checked now is, instead of both
// halves being an unverified claim.
//
// The original argument for a per-method `this` over `ThisType<>` survives
// this correction intact — an explicit annotation is still the position that
// makes `Object.assign(App.prototype, keyMethods)` a call TypeScript can
// refuse. Only the `implements` half of it was wrong.
//
// AppShell is written from the MIXINS' side rather than narrowed FROM App's
// own shape, because App will carry members no mixin needs (constructor
// plumbing, DOM handles private to one
// not-yet-converted mixin) and AppShell exists to describe the SHARED
// surface, not the whole instance. `implements` is the check this file was
// written to make possible: the moment a member this file promises goes
// missing, is renamed, or changes shape on the real class, `class App
// implements AppShell` is a compile error naming exactly which member and
// where — not an `undefined` three files away at runtime, discovered by
// whoever happened to click the right button first.
