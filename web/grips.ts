// grips.ts — the block grip's rules, with no DOM in them.
//
// Every top-level heading, fence, table, figure, display-math block and front
// matter carries one grip in the left gutter, and pressing it opens the block
// composer on that block. Which blocks get one, what its face and its label
// say, how many instructions it already carries, and where two grips go when
// their blocks are closer than one grip are all decisions over a document, a
// list of threads and plain numbers. They live here, where web/probe.mjs
// drives every one of them with no browser — rail.ts's rule, for rail.ts's
// reason. The DOM half (web/figures.ts) measures, calls in here, and paints
// what it is told.
//
// NOTHING HERE TOUCHES `document`, `window` or an EditorView, and nothing here
// imports from card.ts, figures.ts or entry.ts, which all do.
//
// THE SIZES ARE NOT HERE. The grip's size and the gutter it sits in are
// `--gly-grip-size` and `--gly-grip-gutter` in editor.css, and the DOM half
// hands `stackGrips` the height it MEASURED. A pixel constant here beside a
// pixel value there is two spellings of one size, and the day one is retuned
// without the other the grips overlap by exactly the difference.
