// card.ts — ONE CARD, AND ONE WAY A CARD SHOWS WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
//
// THIS FILE EXISTS BECAUSE THE SAME SURFACE WAS BUILT TWICE. The draft's
// instruction rail and History's changes rail are both *a column of cards
// beside the prose they are about*, and until 2026-08-20 they shared a CSS
// vocabulary (`.gly-card`, `.gly-card-head`, `.gly-card-body`) and NOTHING
// ELSE. `web/versions.js` imported nothing from `web/rail.ts`; the two rails
// did not know each other existed. (`versions.js` and not `.ts` is deliberate
// and is not a stale reference: this clause is dated — "until 2026-08-20" —
// and on that date versions genuinely was JavaScript while rail already was
// not. A sweep of stale filenames rewrote it once; the old name is the
// correct name for the moment being described.)
// Every one of the divergences that cost
// something this week was a consequence of that and not of any decision
// anybody took:
//
//   - History's stacker did not SORT, so a non-monotonic change list — a moved
//     sentence, a table cell — mis-stacked and a card could never reach its
//     mark. `stackCards` sorts, and says why.
//   - two gaps (10 and 12) for one arithmetic.
//   - History interleaved reads and writes inside its placement loop: one
//     forced reflow per card, where `paintAnchors` reads all then writes all
//     and states the reason.
//   - History had no `ResizeObserver`, which CLAUDE.md names as the guard that
//     makes stacking-against-a-measurement safe at all ("A CARD'S HEIGHT IS NOT
//     A CONSTANT").
//   - History's own click handler reimplemented the reveal without
//     `prefers-reduced-motion`, without the stall watch, and without the ring.
//
// CLAUDE.md: *"ONE SURFACE, ONE LANGUAGE — AND THE FIX FOR TWO THINGS DOING ONE
// JOB IS DELETION, NOT A RESTYLE."* So the second implementation is deleted and
// both callers build on what is here.
//
// WHY NOT `rail.ts`. That module's first line is a promise — *"Nothing here
// touches the DOM, ProseMirror, or the network"* — and it is load-bearing:
// `probe.mjs` drives every function in it with no browser, which is the whole
// reason the rail's arithmetic is checkable at all. Putting `document` in there
// would end that. So the PURE half of the collapse (`stackCards`, `RAIL_GAP`,
// `GUTTER_PX`, `RAIL_MIN_WIDTH`) stays in rail.ts and both rails import it from
// there; the DOM half is here, and both rails import it from here. One
// implementation either way — the split is by what can be checked without a
// browser, not by which surface is calling.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE. `threadCard` is not, and must not become,
// the History card's builder. It reads `thread.run`, builds the edit and
// delete verbs and carries the two-step arm — a change is not a thread and has none of that. What is shared is the
// ANATOMY (an article, a mono head, an optional body) and the GESTURE (click or
// Enter to be shown the words this card is about). A builder that knows what a
// thread is stays in the file that knows what a thread is.

// The pure half of the collapse, which stays where probe.mjs can drive it with
// no browser. See the paragraph above about the split.

/**
 * cardShell builds the one card anatomy: an `<article class="gly-card">` with a
 * `.gly-card-head` already in it.
 *
 * THE HEAD IS NOT OPTIONAL AND THE BODY IS. Every card on every surface leads
 * with a mono chrome line saying what kind of thing this is — `INSTRUCTION ·
 * WHOLE DOCUMENT · 4M AGO`, `CHANGE 2 OF 5 · design`, `ROUND 3 · JUST NOW` —
 * and what comes after it differs: a suggestion card quotes the document, a
 * thread card carries entries and verbs and no `.gly-card-body` at all, a change
 * card carries asks and a note. So the head is built here and the body is asked
 * for (see cardBody) by the callers that have one.
 *
 * THE ELEMENT IS AN `<article>`, INCLUDING WHERE IT USED TO BE A `<button>`.
 * History's landing cards were buttons hand-rolling the card language from
 * scratch — their own background, border, radius, padding, cursor, type and
 * colour, every one of them a second spelling of `.gly-card`'s, and every one
 * of them there because a `<button>` has a user-agent appearance to undo. A
 * card is not a button: it CONTAINS controls on three of the four surfaces it
 * renders on, and a control inside a control is a thing a screen reader cannot
 * describe (see suggestionCard, where that reasoning was first written down).
 * `revealOn` is what makes it reachable from the keyboard instead.

// that had moved the mark one pixel, so on every profile where smooth scrolling
// genuinely worked the fallback fired and cut it to a hard jump — defeating

 * which was a defect on the History side — no sort, a wider gap, reads
 * interleaved with writes, a rounded top fed forward unrounded, and a height
 * written unconditionally with a trailing gap. The arithmetic was already
 * shared-able (`stackCards` has always been in rail.ts); what was not was the
 * PASS around it, so the pass is here now and neither caller owns a copy.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CALLER STILL OWNS IS THE MEASUREMENT, and that is the real
 * difference between the two rails rather than an accident: the draft measures a
 * mark through ProseMirror (`coordsAtPos`, or a block's element) and History
 * measures a diff mark through `querySelector` on rendered HTML. Neither can be
 * expressed in the other's terms. So the caller hands over what it measured and
 * this places it.
 *
 * READS ARE ALREADY DONE. Every `anchorTop` and `height` in `measured` was read
 * before this was called, which is the contract that keeps one reflow from
 * becoming one per card: `getBoundingClientRect` forces layout and every style
 * assignment invalidates it, so a pass that interleaves them pays per card.
 *
 * NOTHING BUT A POSITION IS WRITTEN ON A CARD. That is what makes it safe for a
 * `ResizeObserver` over those same cards to schedule this pass: a re-measure
 * cannot resize anything, so the observer cannot feed itself. The ONE size
 * written is the CONTAINER's, and it is the stated exception — the container's
 * children are absolutely positioned and contribute no height of their own, so
 * without it whatever follows the map is drawn over the top of it; and a card is
 * inset `left`/`right` inside the container, so its box depends on the
 * container's WIDTH and never on its height.
 *
 * ADRIFT CARDS GO AFTER THE MAP, IN ORDER, AND ARE COUNTED. A card whose anchor
 * this pass could not measure has `top: auto` — its static position, the
 * container's own top — so it would be drawn at the top of the map while
 * contributing nothing to the height below it; with every card adrift the
 * container stayed 0 tall and the whole map was underneath them. The end of the
 * map is the honest place: a card that points at nothing has no mark to be
 * beside, and that is where everything else with nowhere to be already goes.
