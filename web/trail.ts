// trail.ts — the trail: the review remembers what the reviewer's hand did.
//
// The reviewer's edits apply directly (the reviewer's-hand cut) and nothing
// waits on them — but the review keeps the story (the 2026-08-15 trail spec).
// This plugin watches REVIEWER-originated transactions, records each text edit
// as a trail entry {old, new, blockKey, prefix/suffix}, and renders the
// record as DECORATIONS: a deletion leaves its ghost — the removed text struck
// in del-red at the spot it left — and an insertion glows in ins-teal. They
// are decorations in ProseMirror's sense, NEVER content (note.ts's doctrine:
// anything shown-but-not-content must be a decoration), so the projected .md
// stays clean text by construction.
//
// WHAT IS NOT RECORDED, each exclusion deliberate:
//
//   agent changes    a server mutation arrives as a whole-document rebuild
//                    through the ySync plugin, and every ySync-stamped
//                    transaction is skipped — the same discriminator
//                    keepPlace and the suggestion plugin already branch on.
//   structure        only TEXT steps are trailed: a ReplaceStep wholly inside
//                    one textblock whose slice is inline text. A join, a
//                    split, a wrap and a mark toggle apply untracked, exactly
//                    as the reviewer's-hand contract says formatting and
//                    structure do.
//   an undone edit   Cmd-Z RETRACTS the entry rather than recording a second
//                    inverse edit. y-prosemirror stamps undo/redo transactions
//                    (ySync meta's isUndoRedoOperation); each step is paired
//                    against an entry by position and text, an exact pair is
//                    removed, and an ambiguous one retracts nothing and
//                    records nothing — never double-record.
//
// RE-ANCHORING IS BEST-EFFORT AND HONEST. Live, entry ranges map through
// transactions; after a reload (or a rebuild, which is a reload the websocket
// delivers) an entry is re-found from blockKey + surrounding context, and one
// that cannot be placed UNAMBIGUOUSLY renders in the log only — adrift-style,
// never guessed onto the wrong text. Ambiguity refuses, as everywhere in
// galley. ONE ENTRY HAS NO TEXT TO BE FOUND BY and re-anchors structurally
// instead: a deletion that emptied its own block has no `new` and, since
// context is clamped to that block, no affixes either — its anchor is the
// empty block it left (emptyBlockAnchor). "An empty block" is not enough on
// its own, and that was a bug: it identifies a DOCUMENT as unambiguous and
// says nothing about the block being this entry's, so the entry carries the
// text of the blocks either side of its own (`before`/`after`) and a candidate
// has to match both. No evidence, or evidence that does not match, refuses.
//
// Everything below the plugin is pure arithmetic over documents and entry
// lists, exported so probe.mjs drives every rule with no browser.

/**
 * expandToWord widens a stored entry to the WORD a human reads. DISPLAY ONLY —

 * STORAGE IS MINIMAL AND MUST STAY MINIMAL. trimAffixes explains why: the
 * undo's own diff is minimal, so an entry stored any wider can never pair with
 * the undo that reverts it and survives as a phantom the agent reads as
 * decided fact. But the minimal form is mathematically true and humanly alien
 * — "could" → "should" stores as {old:'c', new:'sh'}, because "ould" is a
 * shared suffix, and a log row reading `"c" → "sh"` says nothing about what
 * the reviewer's own hand did. So the two forms are separated by SURFACE
 * rather than reconciled: the entry stays minimal, and every place that SHOWS
 * one calls this.
 *
 * The rule is one walk each way from the stored region's edges, out to the
 * nearest whitespace-or-punctuation boundary, and the SAME two affixes glued
 * onto BOTH sides — which is what makes the three cases fall out rather than
 * needing to be special-cased:
 *
 *   an entry already at word boundaries expands to itself (both affixes empty)
 *   a pure insertion inside a word shows the whole word on both sides:
 *     {old:'', new:'o'} in "word" displays wrd → word
 *   an entry with no context at all — an adrift record whose place could not
 *     be re-found — passes through in its stored form, which is all the log
 *     can honestly say about it.
 *
 * `context` is {prefix, suffix}: the document text immediately around the
 * entry. The entry's OWN stored prefix/suffix are the fallback, so a log row
 * needs no second argument; a caller with a live document (the decorations)
 * passes the live text instead. Both are bounded — TRAIL_CONTEXT_CHARS a side,
 * clamped to the block — so a word longer than its context shows as much of
 * itself as the context holds. Best-effort, display only, never stored.
 *
 * @returns lead and tail are the affixes themselves, so a caller placing
 *   DECORATIONS can widen its positions by exactly what it widened the text by.

 * Selecting `simpler` and typing `the simpler shape` is one gesture; every
 * keystroke merges into one entry, and at `the simpler` the stored form is
 * `trimAffixes('simpler', 'the simpler')` = `{old: '', new: 'the '}` — because
 * `simpler` is a shared SUFFIX. That is correct storage (see trimAffixes: an
 * entry stored any wider can never pair with the undo that reverts it), and it
 * moves the entry's END seven characters back from where the caret is. The next

 *     simpler → the simpler        just now
 *     simpler → simpler shape      just now
 *

 * HAND COULD HAVE EMPTIED — which is the only population `emptyBlockAnchor`
 * may search, in either direction.
 *
 * THREE KINDS ARE EXCLUDED AND EACH IS UNREACHABLE TO A KEYBOARD.
 *
 *   a code fence   `suggestions.ts`'s transaction filter refuses every edit
 *                  that rewrites one, so nothing typed here can empty it —
 *                  and an empty fence is a document shape that exists AT
 *                  REST. Measured: a `.md` holding ``` on two adjacent lines
 *                  gives the browser one empty textblock before a key is
 *                  pressed, which was enough on its own to make a real
 *                  deletion's ghost refuse for ambiguity. That is the user's
 *                  original bug reproduced by an ordinary document.
 *   a table        literal for the same reason and refused by the same
 *                  filter. Its cells are excluded WITH it, because a cell's
 *                  content is a paragraph (TipTap's `tableCell` is `block+`)
 *                  and a paragraph in a table is still not the reviewer's.
 *                  THIS EXCLUSION NOW HAS A REAL POPULATION, and the note
 *                  here used to say it did not: a blank cell was measured
 *                  never reaching the browser as an empty paragraph at all,
 *                  because `markdown.tableRow` gave an empty cell no child
 *                  and y-prosemirror DELETES a `tableCell` that cannot
 *                  satisfy `block+`. That deletion was projected to the
 *                  author's .md — every value after a blank cell slid one
 *                  column left, on open, with no keystroke — so the empty
 *                  population was a symptom of a data-corruption bug rather
 *                  than a property to rely on. Parse gives every cell a block
 *                  now, so a blank cell IS an empty paragraph and this
 *                  exclusion is load-bearing rather than precautionary.
 *                  web/typing.mjs §0 and §6 pin both facts.
 *   a note         `note.ts` renders it `contenteditable="false"`; its words
 *                  are authored through the composer and the rail, never by
 *                  typing into the document.
 *
 * Excluding them is safe in both directions and that is the whole argument: a
 * reviewer's deletion can never PRODUCE one, so counting them can only add a
 * false refusal (§6's bug) or offer a wrong anchor (§8's) — never a right
 * answer this would lose.

// sixteen. Measured since, in a real chromium (141.0.7390.37), timing
// settleEntries over the document a server-side mutation leaves — median, with
// the search's own node counter beside it:
//
//   entries   adjacent strikes          identical stanza

/**
 * placeEmptyBlocks resolves the block-emptying entries AS A SET, and it is the
 * ONE rule for placing them — emptyBlockAnchor below is this function with a
 * set of one, so there is no second rule to drift.
 *
 * WHY A SET AND NOT n INDEPENDENT QUESTIONS. Every rung above searches for
 * TEXT; a deletion that emptied its own block has none, so all it can bring is
 * the text of the blocks either side (`before`/`after`) and the fact that its
 * block is empty. Asked one entry at a time that evidence is often ambiguous
 * and the entry refuses — correctly, on its own terms. But two entries asked
 * TOGETHER know two things a single entry cannot: no two of them can be on the
 * SAME block (a block holds one emptiness, and applyRecord coalesces anything
 * that touches an existing entry), and they are LISTED IN DOCUMENT ORDER.
 * Measured before this existed, on the trail's own passes:
 *
 *   two paragraphs struck between three IDENTICAL lines — both entries carry
 *     the same evidence, both refused, and both ghosts were lost on the next
 *     server-side mutation. Ordinary in a list or a repeated stanza.
 *   four adjacent paragraphs struck — the two INTERIOR entries both record
 *     "an empty block above, an empty block below" and refused; the outer two
 *     anchored. Two ghosts of four.
 *   two struck between identical lines, then the lower gap closed — the lower
 *     entry's block was joined away, its stale evidence still matched the
 *     UPPER entry's block, and its ghost was drawn there: TWO GHOSTS ON ONE
 *     BLOCK, the reviewer reading two deletions on a line that lost one.
 *
 * The third of those is a WRONG ANCHOR, which spec decision 3 rates worse than
 * a missing one — and no per-entry rung can see it, because the block is only
 * taken from the other entry's point of view.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS A FACT ABOUT THE LIST, AND THE LIST ONLY SPEAKS FOR ENTRIES
 * THAT HAD A PLACE. settleEntries sorts by position on every pass, so the
 * trail is in document order — but it sorts entries with NO place to the end,
 * where their position in the list means nothing at all. So each entry carries
 * `placed`: true when it had a place at the settle that last wrote it, false
 * when it did not, and absent before its first settle. An entry is ORDERED —
 * allowed to constrain and be constrained by the order — exactly when that is
 * true. An entry no settle has written is therefore unordered, and an
 * ambiguity the order would have settled REFUSES for it, which is the honest
 * degradation: the field cannot be invented for an entry nobody has placed.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT USED, AND WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: how far a candidate
 * is from where the entry used to be. Every server-side mutation arrives as
 * ONE whole-document ReplaceStep (y-prosemirror rebuilds the doc), and every
 * position inside a replaced range maps to the same edge of it — measured, two
 * entries 26 positions apart both mapped to 26. The distance signal is not
 * weak here, it is GONE, and a rung leaning on it would be reading noise.
 * `at` is not used either: the order edits were MADE in is not the order they
 * sit in.
 *
 * THE RESOLUTION. Each entry's compatible candidates are those its evidence
 * matches; a candidate another entry still stands in is not offered at all
 * (`held`). Over that graph the search takes the MAXIMUM-cardinality injective
 * assignments that respect the order among the ordered entries, and an entry
 * is placed only where EVERY one of them gives it the same candidate.
 * Maximum-cardinality rather than all-or-nothing so that an entry with NO
 * compatible candidate — its block is simply gone — cannot cost its neighbours
 * their ghosts; same-in-every-assignment rather than first-found because a
 * choice the search had to make is exactly the ambiguity that must refuse. Two
 * entries and three candidates they all match still refuses, and so does any
 * set whose order is not established. Note the limit of the first half: an
 * entry whose block is gone but whose stale evidence still OVERLAPS its
 * neighbours' is not dropped, it competes — several assignments are equally
 * large, they disagree, and everybody refuses. That is a lost ghost rather than
 * a wrong one, which is the safe direction, but it is not "cannot cost its
 * neighbours".
 *
 * THE BOUND IS TRAIL_SET_CAP ENTRIES, with the node budget as a backstop under
 * it — both stated, and measured, where they are declared above. Past either,
 * the weak rule: one compatible candidate and nobody else wanting it.
 *

/**
 * emptyBlockAnchor places the ONE entry the text ladder can never place: a
 * deletion that emptied its own textblock.
 *
 * THE DEFECT IT EXISTS FOR. Every rung of `reanchor` is a search for TEXT —
 * `prefix + new + suffix`, found in the document as it now reads. A deletion
 * has no `new` by definition, and `contextOf` clamps its context to the
 * entry's own textblock, which this deletion has just emptied — so both
 * affixes come back '' and the needle is the EMPTY STRING. The ladder skips an
 * empty needle and answers null, so the first thing that invalidates live
 * positions set the entry adrift and its ghost stopped rendering. That first
 * thing is not rare: EVERY server-side mutation replaces the whole document
 * (CLAUDE.md), so filing a comment, or an agent's proposal arriving, was
 * enough — measured: delete a paragraph, ghost renders, `△ 1 changed`; POST
 * one comment; ghost gone, entry still in `/_galley/pending` and in the
 * sidecar holding the deleted text. The record survived; only its place was
 * lost.
 *
 * WHAT SUCH AN ENTRY STILL KNOWS is not text but STRUCTURE: it left a
 * textblock with nothing in it, and the rebuild carries that empty block
 * through (the projection round-trips it).
 *
 * UNIQUENESS ALONE IS NOT IDENTIFICATION, AND THAT WAS THIS RUNG'S OWN BUG.
 * "Exactly one empty block in the document" says the document is unambiguous;
 * it says NOTHING about the block being the one this entry emptied, and the
 * two come apart on an ordinary gesture. Strike a paragraph, then press
 * Backspace once more to close up the blank: the join is a cross-block step,
 * so `recordOf` declines it and nothing new is recorded, the entry maps into
 * the merged paragraph where `verifyEntry` rightly refuses it, and its own
 * block no longer exists. With one other empty block anywhere in the document
 * — screens away, in prose the reviewer never touched — the ghost was drawn
 * THERE. Measured, in web/typing.mjs §8. That is a deletion reported where
 * none happened, which is a worse failure than the missing ghost this rung was
 * added to fix: spec decision 3 is that the trail refuses rather than guesses,
 * and a refusal costs a ghost while a guess costs the reader's trust in every
 * other one.
 *
 * SO THE ENTRY MUST BRING EVIDENCE, and what it brings is `before`/`after` —
 * the text of the blocks either side of the block it emptied, recorded by
 * `contextOf` at the moment of the edit and refreshed on every settle for as
 * long as the entry keeps its place. A candidate qualifies only when BOTH
 * sides match. Both, not either: after a join the surviving empty block can
 * inherit the joined block's own neighbour on one side, so a one-sided rule
 * accepts exactly the case the two-sided one refuses.
 *
 * AND "NO BLOCK THAT SIDE" IS NOT "AN EMPTY BLOCK THAT SIDE". Each side is
 * `null` for the first and a string — possibly '' — for the second, because
 * one value for both is a comparison that cannot tell them apart, and the
 * two-sided rule then passes on BOTH sides at once: an entry that emptied a
 * block whose neighbour was itself empty matched a block standing at the
 * document's edge, and its ghost was drawn on a block it never touched, beside
 * the ghost that block did own. Two block-emptying deletions on adjacent
 * blocks and one Backspace to close the gap is all it takes. Measured on the
 * shipped build; pinned in probe.mjs both directly and through settleEntries.
 *
 * The failure mode this leaves is a FALSE REFUSAL — a reviewer who rewrites a
 * neighbouring block within TRAIL_CONTEXT_CHARS of the boundary, and only
 * across a rebuild, loses a ghost into the log. That is the acceptable side.
 *
 * An entry with NO evidence (neither neighbour recorded) carries nothing on
 * either side and
 * therefore matches only a candidate that has no neighbours on either side —
 * which is to say the document's ONLY block. That is not a special case bolted
 * on; it is the same comparison, and it lands on refuse everywhere refusal is
 * the honest answer and on the one place where uniqueness really is identity.
 * It is stated here and ASSERTED in probe.mjs, three rows of it: a document of
 * [text, empty, empty] refuses, [text, empty] refuses, and [empty] alone
 * places. The first of those rows anchored — wrongly — for as long as an
 * absent side and an empty one were the same ''.
 *
 * `blockKey` IS NOT THE ANSWER HERE AND MUST NOT BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE ONE. It
 * is stamped from the doc the step applied to, so it names the block's
 * PRE-EDIT content hash — and the edit being recorded is the one that emptied
 * the block, so the key it holds is the key of text that no longer exists. It
 * was measured stale on the very case this function is for.

 * settleEntries is the pass every doc change ends on: anchored entries that

 * re-anchored — or set adrift, log-only, when re-anchoring refuses. Adrift
 * entries only RETRY their anchor when asked (a rebuild, a load): retrying on
 * every keystroke would be a whole-document scan per character.
 *
 * IT IS TWO PASSES BECAUSE THE BLOCK-EMPTYING ENTRIES ARE ONE QUESTION. Every
 * other entry is found by its own text and can be settled alone; a deletion
 * that emptied its block has no text, and n of them against m empty blocks is
 * an ASSIGNMENT — see placeEmptyBlocks for what a set knows that an entry on
 * its own does not, and for the three configurations that were measured wrong
 * before it existed. So the first pass decides what each entry needs, the
 * empty-block entries are resolved together, and the second pass builds the
 * list.
 *
 * A BLOCK AN ENTRY STILL STANDS IN IS NOT FREE. An entry that verified this
 * pass holds its empty block, and `held` takes it out of the candidates — one
 * emptiness is one entry's (applyRecord coalesces anything that touches an
 * existing entry, so a second edit in an emptied block joins its record rather
 * than starting one). Without that, an entry whose own block was joined away
 * could be handed a neighbour's and the reviewer would read two deletions on a
 * line that lost one.
 *
 * AND EVERY ENTRY LEAVES CARRYING `placed`, which is what the NEXT settle reads
 * to know whether this list's order speaks for it. Written from the outcome, never assumed: an entry that
 * ends this pass adrift is sorted to the end below, so its position in the
 * list stops meaning anything and it must not be allowed to constrain anyone.
