// loop.mjs — TWO ACTORS, ONE DOCUMENT, AND THE FILE HAS THE LAST WORD.
//
// The gate none of the other four is. `verify` compiles, `layers` reads paint,
// `motion` measures geometry across a click, `typing` drives a keyboard. Each
// tests ONE LAYER with ONE ACTOR. Every defect this branch found was TWO ACTORS
// OVER TIME — a reviewer typing while an agent writes, a Revise press with no
// listener, a document written earlier and reopened later — and not one of the
// four can express that shape.
//
// `galley wait` is what makes it expressible. Before it, scripting the agent
// side needed a hook and a spawned process; a script can now block on the
// document, answer with the CLI verbs, and re-arm. So the agent side here is a
// CHILD PROCESS — this same file, re-invoked with --agent — blocked on
// `galley wait` while the browser half types. The two are genuinely concurrent
// rather than interleaved by this script's own ordering, and that is the whole
// point: a version that ran them in turn would be a slower typing.mjs.
//
// galley never calls a model and never pays for tokens. The agent side is the
// CLI verbs and the FILE, and nothing else.
//
// THE ASSERTION NO OTHER GATE MAKES is the last section. Every existing gate
// asserts what the SCREEN shows or what the SERVER reports; none asserts that
// the document of record agrees with BOTH participants — which is exactly where
// `brownred` and the untracked keystroke lived. So this one ends by stopping the
// server and reading the file and the round log under it, with nothing
// running.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// REWRITTEN AGAIN, AND THIS TIME THE OTHER ACTOR CHANGED JOBS.
//
// This file was DEAD before this rewrite, and had been for the whole interval
// since `galley suggest` and `galley apply` were removed. It died at line 440
// with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` reading
// `pendingView.suggestions`, and a gate that throws six checks into a
// fifty-check run reports nothing about the forty-four after it. A dead gate
// is worse than a switched-off one: it is on the list, it is in the justfile,
// and it certifies nothing.
//
// WHAT MOVED. `pendingView` was `{suggestions, comments, changes, blocks}` and
// is `{instructions, blocks}`. The agent does not PROPOSE any more — `galley
// suggest` and `galley apply` are deleted verbs and `/_galley/suggest` is not
// a route — it EDITS THE .md ITSELF, under a handoff galley holds open, and
// says so with one terminal `galley ack`. The reviewer does not ACCEPT or
// REJECT any more — those verbs and their cards are gone — they FILE
// INSTRUCTIONS, which are immutable facts of a round rather than a
// conversation, and then press Revise.
//
// SO THE GATE'S SUBJECT SURVIVED AND ITS CAST SWAPPED ROLES. It was: the
// reviewer edits directly, the agent proposes, the reviewer decides, and the
// file holds every outcome in the form the reviewer chose. It is: the reviewer
// edits directly, the reviewer ASKS, the agent REVISES THE FILE, and the file
// holds the agent's revision and the reviewer's own hand with nothing tracked
// on either. The last section is unchanged in kind and stronger in one
// respect — the agent's work is IN THE BYTES rather than in markup awaiting a
// decision, so "the document of record agrees with both participants" is a
// claim about the prose itself and not about a settled markup state.
//
// WHAT WAS DELETED RATHER THAN TRANSLATED. Named here and again at each site,
// because a gate that keeps its count by inventing an equivalent reports
// safety it does not provide:
//
//   §3's SUGGESTION PAIR AND §5's ACCEPT/REJECT — `galley suggest --replace`
//   twice, then `.gly-card-accept` and `.gly-card-reject` clicked in the rail,
//   then the file read back for "ACCEPTED: the replacement is in the file with
//   no marker on it" and "REJECTED: the original stands". There is no verb, no
//   card, no class and no outcome to read: the agent's revision IS the file,
//   and nobody decides it. Six checks.
//
//   §2's AND §4's REPLY AND ITS HALF-WRITTEN DRAFT — the sharpest of the ten
//   findings from the first human session, a reply box cleared mid-sentence by
//   somebody else's write, staged here as three agent writes landing under a
//   textarea with a caret at offset 9. Edit mode has no reply box: an
//   instruction card is a head, the reviewer's one sentence and a two-step
//   delete (read `.gly-rail` on a live page and see), `/_galley/reply` and
//   `/_galley/resolve` are review-mode routes only, and `draftFields()` finds
//   nothing to carry. Five checks.
//
//   AND ITS OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR WAS CONSIDERED AND REFUSED. "The reviewer keeps
//   typing in the DOCUMENT while the agent's revision lands" is the same
//   finding on today's surface, and it is STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE: entry.ts
//   runs `this.editor.setEditable(!this.handoff)`, so from the Revise press to
//   the ack the document is not editable at all. There is no in-flight
//   reviewer work for an agent write to destroy, and a check that manufactured
//   some would be testing a state the product cannot be in. §4 asserts the
//   lock instead, which is the fact that replaced the hazard.
//
//   §5's RESOLVE AND ITS TWO-SIDED THREAD — `.gly-thread-resolve`, then the
//   sidecar read back for a thread `resolved: true` holding both sides of the
//   conversation. An instruction is discharged by the revision, not resolved
//   by the reviewer, and it carries one side because there is only one side.
//   Three checks.
//
//   AND EVERY OTHER SIDECAR READ WITH THEM. `galley edit` writes no
//   `<doc>.comments.json` at any point in a round — measured, not inferred;
//   see the note where §6's sidecar check used to be. The ask's durable home
//   is `rounds.jsonl`, which §6 reads instead. One check.
//
//   §5b's `liveDeletes`/`offlineDeletes` AGREEMENT — Gap 7's grave, live and
//   offline both counting pending DELETIONS at zero. Neither number exists:
//   `pending` reports instructions, which have no kind. The claim underneath
//   it — the settled file holds no CriticMarkup of any kind — is kept and is
//   asserted over ALL spans rather than over `{--` alone. Two checks.
//
// A FINDING THIS REPAIR TURNED UP AND IS NOT THIS BRANCH'S TO FIX: a wake
// carries its instructions WITHOUT THEIR KEYS. `waitFingerprint` builds them
// through `reviewerInstructions`, which sets `Text`, `Quote` and `At` and not
// `Key`, while `galley agent-prompt` tells the agent to name the instruction
// it answered "by the key galley handed you with the round". A `galley wait`
// session is handed none. §3 pins the shape as it actually is, and the ack
// below therefore annotates its changes without an `answers` array — which
// the prompt explicitly permits, and which costs the pairing the whole
// history feature exists for.
//
// WHAT A GREEN RUN IS NOT.
//
// It is not a working product. Ten findings came out of the first real human
// session with galley and NOT ONE had been caught by a test; five more came out
// of the day this file was written, every one of them from driving a layer
// nobody had driven. A gate protects what we have already learned to assert. It
// cannot notice that something feels wrong, that a card lands in the wrong
// place, or that the loop is exhausting to actually use. Green here means the
// things that broke before have not broken again. Nothing more.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just build
//   GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/loop.mjs
//
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. There is no `just loop`
// any more — the justfile keeps a target for `rounds-ux` alone — so it is
// spelled out here rather than pointed at a recipe that is not there.
