// web/history.ts owns History: the versions door, entering and leaving the
// reading mode, restoring a version as a fresh draft, and the arrival strip
// that says a round came back.
//
// It is a MIXIN — an object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto `App.prototype`
// in entry.ts — not a class of its own, so every method here still reads and
// writes `this` on the live App instance exactly as it did before the move
// (`this.editor`, `this.census`, `this.versionsPanel`, `this.bar`, and so on).
// `this` IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own
// header for the this-typing decision.
//
// THIS WAS THE PARTITION'S SINGLE BIGGEST OPEN CALL. Most of these methods'
// DOM writes land on chrome — the versions chip, the primary —
// so a partition by pixels would file them under the bar. They are not bar
// chrome. web/versions.ts's own header states History "is a READING MODE and
// not a second application," and a reading mode filed under a module named
// for the bar buries that distinction exactly where the next reader will not
// look.
//
// paintVersionsButton also paints `this.bar.versions`, the narrow bottom-bar
// chip owned by web/sheet.ts. That cross-group write is expected: mixins all
// land on one shared prototype, so writing another module's element here is
// ordinary, not a boundary violation.
//
// readArrival is driven from readRevise, which lives in web/verdict.ts now. A
// method here being called from a method in another mixin is fine — same
// prototype, same `this`.

  // this method RAN (instrumented, `openInstructions called 1 time(s)`) — and
