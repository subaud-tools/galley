// grip.mjs — ONE GRIP FOR EVERY BLOCK.
//
// Every top-level heading, fence, table, image, mermaid diagram, display-math
// block and front-matter block carries one grip in the left gutter, visible
// without hovering, and pressing it opens the block composer on that block.
// This gate holds every claim about the grip that crosses kinds. The claims a
// single kind owns stay with that kind's gate (codeblock.mjs for the fence's
// deny line, rounds-ux.mjs for the section's round).
//
// The rules that need no browser — which blocks get a grip, its face and
// label, its count, how two crowded grips stack — are web/grips.ts's, checked
// in probe.mjs. What only a browser can say is whether a reviewer can SEE and
// PRESS the grip, and what pressing it moves. That is this file.
//
// THE FIXTURE carries the shapes a wrong implementation gets wrong:
//
//   - every kind that takes a grip, and every kind that must not;
//   - an h2 directly followed by a table, two blocks closer than one grip,
//     which is the case that proves the grips stack;
//   - a table that is not the last block;
//   - a fence nested in a list item, which is not a top-level block and gets
//     no grip;
//   - a figure (an SVG served beside the document, as layers.mjs does) low
//     enough on the page that a composer placed wrongly is visible;
//   - closing paragraphs, enough that the last blocks can be scrolled near
//     the top of the window with room for the form beneath them;
//   - a last heading too long for a composer's head to quote whole.
//
// The file's name is long on purpose: a short fixture name leaves the bar's
// title room it never has for a real document, and the bar does not fold.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just grip
//
// which is `just build` and then `GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/grip.mjs`.
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. It is in `just gates`, and a
// step of its own in ci.yml.

# The block grip

Every block a reviewer may want to speak to as a whole carries one grip.

## Budget
| key | value |
| --- | --- |
| retries | 3 |
| timeout | 30s |

  \`\`\`bash
  npm install -g galley

> A quotation gets no grip; a selection is the way to point at it.

\`\`\`bash

\`\`\`

Some prose between the fence and the figure, so the figure sits low enough
on the page that a composer placed against the wrong box is visible.

That is the whole of it, and nothing else is required.

scrolls far enough to put the equation near the top of the window, where
the form's grown height fits beneath it.

scrolls far enough to put the equation near the top of the window, where
