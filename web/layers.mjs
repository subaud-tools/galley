// ======================= THIS GATE RUNS, AND IS LOAD-BEARING =================
//
// `node web/layers.mjs` is 263/0 as of this migration and has been one of the
// four gates guarding every extraction in it — `just verify`'s local runs and
// CI both hold it green. It drives a real chromium against a real
// `galley edit` and reads `getComputedStyle`, which is the only way to catch
// the CSS bug class this file exists for: a more-specific selector silently
// beating an intended one, so a rule ships reviewed and never applies. If this
// file goes dark again, say so here the way this note once had to — a banner
// that is wrong in the safe direction still cost four gates staying silently
// dead for weeks, once.
//
// ITS HISTORY, FOR CONTEXT ON THE FIXTURE BELOW: it once WAS dark. Measured
// 2026-08-20 on `main` at 4b5561d, the gate died in its fixture setup —
//
//     Command failed: bin/galley suggest <fixture>.md --comment ... --on ...
//     galley: unknown command "suggest"
//
// — because `galley suggest` and `galley apply` had been deleted by `1cb6937
// review: complete the rounds-only architecture` and `a052b4a feat!: remove
// galley apply`. The agent's write surface became the file itself, and the
// reviewer's surface became an instruction rail rather than a population of
// decidable proposals; this file's fixture was never carried across, so every
// one of its checks went dark with nothing shouting about it.
//
// WHAT THE PALETTE-AND-PRIMARY BRANCH THEN CHANGED UNDER IT, kept here so the
// repair did not resurrect a check for something that was already gone by the
// time it landed: `.gly-revise-trail` and its 23ch reserve were DELETED (the
// trail's clause stopped being written when the rounds-only workflow arrived,
// and the reserve outlived the words); the pending count sits in
// `.gly-revise-count` on the same button, with the same argument; and the
// `.gly-amber` state class became `.gly-on`, because the colour it was named
// for moved to `--gly-signal`. It was not that branch that broke this gate —
// it was already dark — and that branch could not use this gate to hold the
// property it is here for; `web/rounds-ux.mjs` held the nothing-moves
// property over the primary's label in the meantime, see 'the primary
// changing its label moves nothing in the bar' there.
//
// The fixture was since rebuilt against the rounds-only product (the checks
// below read the instruction rail and the sealed/reopened states it actually
// has), which is how the gate is 263/0 now rather than a rewritten claim to
// be dark less convincingly.
// ===========================================================================
//
// layers.mjs — the computed-style gate for the visual system.
//
// IT IS SEQUENCED BY STATE, NOT BY SECTION NUMBER. The blocks run §1b, §1c, §4,
// §4b, §3, §5, §5b, §1, §7, §7a–§7e, and that order is deliberate rather than
// drift: the resting bar colours have to be read BEFORE the overall handle is
// clicked (amber on an open handle is correct and would be read as a
// regression), the panel has to be OPEN before §7's dark-mode loop can read
// `.gly-overall`, and the settled region has to be opened before §4b can read a
// card in it. One instrument, driven through the states in the order the
// product reaches them; the section numbers are the handoff spec's, and they
// are not a running order. Every state a block sets, it also puts back.
//
// docs/design/2026-08-08-handoff-spec.md assigns every element to exactly one
// of three layers, and every change it asks for is PAINT. Paint is invisible to
// motion.mjs, which measures rects, and invisible to probe.mjs, which has no
// DOM at all. It is also where this stylesheet's worst class of bug lives:
// `.gly-card button` (0,1,1) silently beats `.gly-thread-delete` (0,1,0), so a
// rule can be written, reviewed, commented and shipped without ever applying.
// Reading the CSS does not catch that. getComputedStyle does.
//
// Not part of `just verify` — it drives a real chromium against a real
// `galley edit`, neither of which CI has. `just layers` is the gate any change
// to a surface, a card or a verb has to clear before it lands.

// THE NAME IS PART OF THE FIXTURE, and `doc.md` made the widest entry in §7a's
// sweep decorative. The document's name renders in `.gly-doc` at the head of
// the bar, so it is one of the widths the bar has to fit — and at six
// characters it left 1600px with room to spare, so the bar never folded there
// and "every control can be pressed at 1600px" PASSED AGAINST THE BROKEN
// BUILD. A probe with a realistic name failed at that same width. A check that
// can only pass is not a check.
//
// Twenty-eight characters is an ordinary filename, not a stress test — this
// file's own name is twelve and the plan documents beside it are longer. It
// used to fold the bar at 1600, which is what let the sweep's top entry fail
// again; then the untracked sentence became a basis-0 bar cell and the
// whole-doc handle dropped "on the whole doc", and the boundary moved.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-16, against the ONE readout: flat at 1248px (52.2px tall),
// folded at 1246 (91.4px). Re-measured because the previous figures here
// (flat 1240, folded 1230) were taken while the bar still had three readout
// cells and the standing sentence still had a `display: none` below 1340 —
// both gone, and the boundary went the OPPOSITE way from the arithmetic on
// gaps alone: two fewer cells is 24px less bar, but the sentence no longer
// leaves at 1340, so the fold arrives ~16px WIDER rather than narrower. Which
// is exactly why this is measured and not reasoned.
//
// The sweep's 1200/1100/1000/992 widths still walk a folded bar with it, and
// THAT IS ASSERTED NOW rather than left to this comment — see the fold checks
// after the sweep loop. Held by a filename alone it was the fixture hazard
// CLAUDE.md names, in the gate that sweeps eleven widths. 1600 walking a flat
// bar is no longer a fixture hole but the product's own new shape — an
// ordinary name is not SUPPOSED to fold 1600 any more, and motion.mjs carries
// a name long enough to fold its own wide viewport on purpose.
//
// RE-MEASURED 2026-08-20, against the instruction bar. The bar lost its
// `Instructions · N` chip to one filled primary and the whole-document handle
// to the rail, so it is narrower again and a 28-character name folded NOTHING:
// measured flat (52.2px) at every one of the sweep's widths down to 992, which
// left every check in that loop walking the shape the rename was meant to stop
// certifying — and the fold assertion after it is what said so. The walk, on
// this bar: 28 characters folds nothing, 40 folds 1100 and below, FIFTY folds
// 1200 and below while leaving 1600 flat (52.2px), 60 folds 1240 too. Fifty-one
// is what ships. Still an ordinary filename, not a stress test.
//
// One measured oddity worth knowing before anyone "fixes" it: 992 folds and
// 991 does NOT. The narrow rules land at 991 — the bar's gap drops 12px → 8px
// across eight items and `.gly-census-count` leaves entirely — and that buys
// back more than the 1px of window costs. The sweep walks both.
//
// Nothing else reads it: `.gly-doc` is the only place it renders in the bar
// (the census handle counts notes and does not name the file), and the panel
// head that does name it is full-bleed and fixed, so its width is the window's
// either way. Checked before renaming.

// --- WHAT THE FIXTURE IS BUILT FROM, AND WHY IT CHANGED ----------------------
//
// This whole block used to be `galley suggest`, `galley resolve`, `galley reply`
// and `galley blocks`, run against the .md before the server was started: two
// ins/del proposals, a resolved thread, eight replies deep enough to cap a
// bubble, a block comment on the figure and a comment whose highlight was then
// taken out from under it. `galley suggest` was deleted with the proposal
// machinery (1cb6937) and `galley apply` after it (a052b4a); `resolve`, `reply`
// and `blocks` went with them. The reviewer's side of the loop is INSTRUCTIONS
// now — an immutable round of asks, sent by one press of Revise — and the agent
// writes the file directly.
//
// So the fixture is seeded over `POST /_galley/instruct`, which is the endpoint
// the composer and the whole-document input already post to (entry.ts), and
// which takes the same three shapes `galley suggest` did: `comment` with a
// plain-text `target`, `comment_block` with a block key, and
// `comment_document`. `guard` in serve.go admits a request with no Origin —
// that is the CLI's shape — so node can post it, and the seeding runs against
// the live server rather than against the file, which is the one difference
// that matters: the document is OPEN, so nothing may write the .md behind it.
//
// THREE POPULATIONS THE PRODUCT NO LONGER HAS, and every check that read them
// is deleted at the section it stood in rather than pointed at a substitute:
//
//   the two `--replace` proposals   §5 and §5b are about the substitution card,
//                                   which is a component with no data to build
//                                   it from.
//   the resolved thread             a card carries one verb, delete; there is
//                                   no resolve, so nothing settles, so §4b and
//                                   §7b' read an empty region forever.
//   the eight replies               a card carries no reply box, so §7c's cap
//                                   has nothing to overflow.
//
// The anchorless thread survives and is built differently: a BLOCK comment is
// filed the ordinary way and the reviewer then deletes its mark IN THE EDITOR.
// (Deleting the words under a TEXT comment retracts the comment instead —
// lostanchor.go — so that gesture makes no unplaced card any more.) That has
// to happen with the browser attached, so it is done in-page at §9 rather than
// here.

// §6 asks for the destroy weight in rail, panel, sheet and settled list alike,
// and this block was the settled list's coverage: it pressed `.gly-census-count`
// to open the sheet on a wide screen, opened the settled region inside it, and
// read six properties off a settled card — that it is a full card, that it
// carries its 3px kind edge, that its head speaks the chrome's mono voice, that
// its delete wears the destroy weight, that it is dimmed to §2's 0.8 rather
// than to resolve's 0.55, and that it offers `↺ reopen`, the only way back from
// a mis-clicked `✓ resolve`. Every one of them was measured red first: the card
// painted 0.55 while the stylesheet said 0.8 in two places, because
// `.gly-card.gly-resolved` (0,2,0) out-specified `.gly-settled-card` (0,1,0).
//
// NOTHING CAN SETTLE ANY MORE. `threadCard` builds one verb — delete — because
// an instruction is immutable work for the next round rather than a
// conversation to answer and settle; there is no `✓ resolve` to press, no
// `↺ reopen` to press it back, and `galley resolve` went with them. So the
// settled region is `hidden` on every run, exactly as it was before this block
// was written, and the trap it was written to escape has closed again from the
// other side: a check reading `.gly-sheet-settled-list .gly-card` would report
// zero matches forever, and `styleAll(...).every(...)` over an empty list is
// `true`. That is the pass-forever shape, and it is why this is a deletion
// rather than a re-point.
//
// AND THE DOOR IT PRESSED IS A DIFFERENT DOOR. `.gly-census-count` was made a
// button so a desktop reviewer could reach the sheet at all; it is the
// INSTRUCTIONS VIEW control now (`openInstructions`, which sets
// `sheetOpen = false` and returns the page to the document), so the press this
// block opened with does the opposite of what it was written to do. Measured:
// `{sheet: false, rail: "block", width: 1600}`.
//
// The destroy weight itself is still read on every surface that renders a card

// --- §5 · the substitution card — DELETED WITH THE SUBSTITUTION -------------
// --- §5b · a replace card is still a card in the band — DELETED WITH IT ------
//
// §5 read the replace card's paint: no `border-image` (a gradient border was
// the mockup's, and it painted OVER the kind edge), the top/right/bottom
// borders the ordinary line, and a left edge that is one 3px rule carrying BOTH
// the deletion and the insertion — the two-colour edge that says at a glance
// that a substitution is one decision and not two. Then it read the body,
// which has to QUOTE the document in the order the change reads: struck text
// first, replacement after it.
//
// §5b was the placement half. Two `--replace`s were in the fixture on purpose,
// because a layout bug that takes replace cards out of the band's absolute
// placement puts the FIRST one at very nearly the right place anyway — it is
// the second and third that land 92px and 185px below their marks — so one
// replace in the fixture was a gate that could not see displacement at all.
//
// There is no replace. `galley suggest --replace` is gone, nothing in the
// product proposes a substitution against the document, and `.gly-card-replace`
// has no writer. Every read here returned `null` and every `styleAll(...)`
// returned `[]`, which is why the fixture guard §5b opens with ("enough replace
// cards to see displacement at all") is the line that went red — the guard
// working, one more time.
//
// THE PLACEMENT CLAIM ITSELF IS NOT UNASSERTED. "Every card in the band is
// placed by the band, not by normal flow, and measures the same as every other
// card in it" is §9's question and §9 asks it over the cards that exist. What
// is gone is the two-colour edge and the old→new body, because a component with
// no data to build it from cannot be read off a screen.

// takeBack deletes an instruction a section filed for its own check, and waits
// for the page to have heard, so the sections after it count what they always
// counted.

// the comment's line breaks and wrap a long token, and only a real browser's
// computed style can say it does.
//
// FILED THROUGH THE COMPOSER, the reviewer's own path: the grip beside the
// title, then the form it opens. The note is then found by its ID — the
// pending instruction's key — and by nothing else: no text is matched, and
// nothing is written into the fragment by this check.
//
// AND IT GROWS. The comment is then edited to three lines, the way the card's
// edit box does it, and every other card is measured before and after. The
// note sits under the title, so every mark in the document is below it and
// moves down with the prose. "A click moves nothing but what was clicked" is

// Full pills belong to verbs on cards and to passive chips. Every chrome
// control is 6px. This is the cheapest signal in the system and the one that
// tells a reviewer, without a word, which things converse and which count.
//
// TWO checks read the census's radius, on purpose, because they answer
// different questions:
//
//   - the COMPUTED check answers "what does the user see". It used to be
//     confounded: `.gly-bar button`, edit.html's inline fallback for the
//     static #gly-revise button, tied `.gly-census button` at (0,1,1) and won
//     on source order because it lived in a later stylesheet — and it also
//     said `border-radius: 6px`, so this check passed with `.gly-census
//     button` reverted to `999px`. §1b's fix moved that rule into this
//     stylesheet ABOVE `.gly-census button`, so the census wins its own paint
//     and this check now discriminates: reverting the declaration to 999px
//     fails it. Verified that way, not assumed.
//   - the RULE check (ruleValue, defined above with the reasoning in full)
//     reads `.gly-census button`'s own declared `border-radius` off the
//     CSSOM, independent of what wins the paint. It is no longer the only
//     one that can tell 6px from 999px, and it stays because a future rule
//     that ties and out-orders the census would re-confound the paint and
//     leave this one standing.
{

// panel's own background was a hardcoded chrome token until this week. So it

//
// Read through getComputedStyle under emulateMedia, deliberately, and NOT
// through ruleValue: the dark tokens live inside
// `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` and ruleValue walks TOP-LEVEL rules
// only, so it would answer null for every one of them — which is
// indistinguishable from "no such declaration". The browser honours the media
// query for free, and the question here is what a reader sees anyway.
//
// `.gly-overall` NEEDS NO OPENING NOW, and that is what makes it present here.
// It used to be disclosed by a toggle §3 pressed; the toggle is deleted (see
// §3), the list of filed whole-document instructions is simply the rail's, and
// the fixture files one at the top of this run. What §3 leaves shut behind it
// is the CAPTURE card, which is a different element and is read there.

// AND "REACHABLE" IS NOT "INSIDE THE WINDOW". This block asserted the rect
// first — `x >= 0 && x + width <= innerWidth` — and that predicate PASSED on a
// button nobody could click: the bar folds, and above the breakpoint its second
// row landed underneath `.gly-rail`, which is `position: fixed` at `z-index:
// 20` over a bar at 10. Measured at 1000px before the rail was taught the bar's
// height: `#gly-revise` at `{x: 834.4, y: 49.2, right: 980}` — wholly inside a
// 1000px window — with `elementFromPoint` at its centre returning
// `.gly-rail-band` and a real click timing out. A rect fully inside the
// viewport underneath an opaque fixed panel satisfies "on screen" and fails
// "the reviewer can press it", and those are two different claims.
//
// So the sweep reads `document.elementFromPoint` back at each control's centre
// and requires that control or a descendant of it. There is precedent one file
// over: motion.mjs reads elementFromPoint back at the coordinate it clicked,
// on the argument that "nothing moved" and "what you clicked is still under
// your finger" are separate facts. This is that distinction, standing still.
//
// The rect check stays. It is cheap, it runs first, and it names something
// real — a control past the right edge with no horizontal scroll is gone
// whatever is or is not painted over where it used to be.
//
// AND IT SWEEPS, because the failure is width-dependent and a single viewport
// is how the previous gap was missed — twice now. Measured on this fixture:
// the bar's content is 1159px wide with the rail on screen and 1066px without
// it, so `#gly-revise` left the window at 1100 and at 1000 — both ABOVE the
// 992px rail breakpoint — and by 900 `.gly-hold` had gone with it, by 768
// `.gly-mode`, by 600 the whole census strip. "Move it to the bottom bar below
// 992" would have left every width between 992 and 1159 exactly as broken.
//
// ONE HEIGHT, AND THAT IS A KNOWN LIMIT. "No control is unreachable" is a
// two-dimensional claim and this sweep varies one dimension. 900px is tall
// enough that nothing in the bar has ever been clipped vertically, and §7c
// below drives 844×390 and 900×260 — the short windows where vertical room is
// the scarce thing — so the gap is covered by a different block rather than
// left open. A control lost to a SHORT window would be missed here.
//
// 1400 and 1450 are in the list because the OVERLAP band is not the overflow
// band. At those widths the bar never spilled — the folded row was created by
// a longer document name, and the rail then covered it. The first ten widths
// this block swept all missed it, and 1400–1450 was the one place where the
// fold made things WORSE than the overflow it replaced: a clipped button still
// had a clickable centre, and a covered one has nothing.

// --- §7b‴ · the narrow bar is still a bar with the sheet open ----------------
//
// A RECT INSIDE THE WINDOW IS NOT A CONTROL THE REVIEWER CAN PRESS, and this is
// that rule in the one state no gate walked: narrow, with the sheet open.
// Measured at 430×900 on the shipped build — `.gly-bottombar` painted, not
// `hidden`, `getBoundingClientRect` at `{y: 860, height: 40}`, `isVisible()`
// true — and `document.elementFromPoint` at each of its four controls' centres
// answering `gly-thread-who` and `gly-thread-entry`: the sheet (z-index 45)
// over the bar (25). All four unreachable, including the two the narrow layout
// has no other spelling of.
//
// THE BAR IS CLAIMED IN THIS STATE BY THREE SEPARATE PIECES OF THE PRODUCT,
// which is what decides the fix rather than taste. `railSurfaces` answers
// `bar: true` below the breakpoint WHETHER OR NOT the sheet is open — the one
// accessor that decides what a width means, and it says the bar renders here,
// where at 992 and above it says `bar: false`. `.gly-sheet` reserves
// `padding-bottom: 52px`, which is the bar's 40px and the sheet's own 12px:
// the sheet's layout was written for a bar painted over it. And `step()` — the
// ↑/↓ this bar is the only home of — carries a branch for exactly this state
// ("the sheet's cards too: with the sheet open it is the surface showing the
// list"). Hiding the bar would contradict all three and take the count, the
// step and the list away at once; making the sheet stop short of it would need
// the bar's height as a second constant in a layout where it is `bar: false`
// above the breakpoint. The bar goes ABOVE the sheet, which is what the 52px
// already assumes, and the sheet's list scrolls under it exactly as the prose
// scrolls under the sticky bar at the top of the page.
//
// THE SIBLING STATE IS ASKED TOO. At and above the breakpoint the sheet is the
// review's whole list and the bottom bar is not painted at all, so the same
// invariant is stated as an implication — a bar that is HIDDEN makes no claim
// — and the wide-with-sheet-open case is recorded as a note beneath it.

// --- §7b″ · the draft carry — DELETED WITH THE REPLY BOX ---------------------
// --- §7b′ · a settled thread reachable here too — DELETED WITH THE RESOLVE ---
//
// §7b″ was the draft-carry block. `paintRail` destroys and rebuilds every card
// on every poll, and `carryDrafts`/`captureDrafts`/`restoreDrafts` existed so a
// half-written reply survived that; `draftRoots()` is the list of surfaces they
// walk, and it is a LIST, so it went stale the moment `threadCard`'s
// `data-draft` reply box was rendered on a FOURTH surface — the rail's band,
// the whole-document panel, the settled list, then the SHEET. Measured before
// the fix at 900x1000: thirty-five characters became `''` with focus on `BODY`,
// while the identical gesture in the rail survived in the same run.
//
// There is no `data-draft` in the page. `threadCard` builds no reply box —
// an instruction is not a conversation to answer — and the one line that still
// writes `dataset.draft` (`reply:${s.run}`) is on the proposal reply, which has
// no proposals to hang off. So `captureDrafts` walks three roots and finds
// nothing, on every poll, in every state: the mechanism is unreachable rather
// than broken, and a check over it would be measuring an empty `Map`. The
// fixture guard this block opens with ("the sheet has a thread reply box to
// half-write into") is the line that went red, which is the guard working.
//
// §7b′ was the settled thread at narrow. `↺ reopen` is the only way back from a
// mis-tapped `✓ resolve` and CLAUDE.md says it is what makes "settles it and
// KEEPS the history" true — so the block opened the sheet's settled region on a
// phone and read the reopen verb, the dim and the head off a card in it. There
// is no resolve verb on a card and `galley resolve` is gone, so nothing settles,
// so the region is `hidden` on every run and its list is empty. Same deletion,
// same reason, as §4b above — and said twice on purpose, because the two blocks
// were each other's cross-reference and a reader arriving at either one should
// not have to find the other to learn why the surface is unasserted.

// --- §7c · below the breakpoint, the mark opens its conversation -------------
//
// The sheet is a LIST — it answers "what is outstanding". It does not answer
// "what is this highlight about", and below 992px nothing else did: the rail
// that carries conversations at wide is gone, and a tap on a highlight opened a
// three-line bubble offering accept and reject on a thing that is resolved,
// never accepted.
//
// So a comment highlight now opens its whole thread, on the same card the rail,
// the panel, the settled list and the sheet draw. Four claims, and the third is
// the one that would be quietly wrong: a conversation COVERS the prose, it does
// not push it.

  // forever. It is deleted because the state it guards has no way in, not
  // because the guard was wrong — and the arithmetic is worth writing down,
  // because the obvious repair (make the fixture thread longer) does not work
  // and somebody will try it.
  //
  // `.gly-bubble-said` is the only region of the card that can give, and the
  // FLOOR under it guarantees room for the first thing anybody said, ENTIRE
  // (that is the check directly below, and it is the one that matters). With
  // eight replies the region could clamp to the room the mark left and let
  // replies two-through-eight scroll. An instruction is a SINGLE immutable
  // entry, so "the first thing anybody said" is the whole thread: the floor and
  // the cap are the same number, and there is no rest to scroll to.
  //
  // Measured while trying: a 665px single entry gives a 756px card that is
  // placed, not capped — at 900x1000 it flips above its mark rather than
  // clamping, and at 390x844 `saidScroll` (672) equals `saidHeight` (671.78),
  // which is a check reporting "nothing overflows" about a card that overflows
  // the window. Lengthening it further only moves the flip. The two constraints
  // are contradictory for one thread — hang BELOW the mark at 900x1000 wants
  // height <= ~697, cap at 390x844 wants > ~713 — and the bubble has a fixed
  // max-width, so the same text is the same height at both.

  // that can give, and it gave to zero — measured at 844×390 and at 390×430,
  // ordinary phone states (a rotation; the software keyboard opening under a
  // tapped reply box), with clientHeight 0 against scrollHeight 336 and no
  // gesture that could recover it. A card that shows a conversation with none
  // of the conversation in it is not a conversation.
  // WHOLLY, not by a sliver. `entriesShown > 0` is satisfied by a region 1px
  // tall — which is what the cap leaves when it is smaller than the pinned
  // chrome — and that is the same shape of check as the three this round is
  // fixing: it asserts the thing it names rather than the thing it means. The

// --- §7e · the collapsed rail — DELETED WITH THE COLLAPSE CONTROL ------------
//
// THE RULE IT GUARDED IS STILL GUARDED, and that is why this is a deletion and
// not a hole. §7e's subject was a STATE, not a claim: collapsed at 1600px,
// `railSurfaces` rendered no rail, no bar and no sheet, so a width test left a
// comment highlight opening a two-verb bubble with the conversation rendered
// NOWHERE — and it was not a corner, because `writeCollapsed` persisted per
// document, so a reviewer who collapsed the rail once opened every later
// session in that state. The block pressed `.gly-collapse`, asserted the rail
// really had gone, and then read the bubble.
//
// There is no collapse control. `makeCollapse` was called from nowhere and
// has since been deleted from entry.ts entirely, along with `toggleCollapse`
// and the rest of the feature: Instructions and History are the two document
// views now, and an arrow-only collapse made the primary view disappear
// behind a glyph. The state was unreachable from the product before the
// deletion too — a `locator('.gly-collapse').click()` simply hung, which is
// how this was found, thirty seconds of waiting for a button nobody built.
//
// The RULE — "is the rail on screen", not "is the window narrow", answered by
// `railSurfaces` and never by a width test — is what §7c and §7d assert
// between them, on the two sides of the breakpoint that the product can still
// reach.

// --- §9 · the rail speaks ONE card language ---------------------------------
//
// A REVISION IS NOT A DIFFERENT KIND OF THING FROM ITS OWN EDITS, and for a
// while the rail said it was. `batchCard` drew the arrival of a revision as a
// receipt — its own container (the anchorless block, in flow, below the band,
// so its own left edge and its own width), its own visual language (a dashed
// accent border and a tinted background, "reads as a receipt rather than as
// another suggestion" in the stylesheet's own words), and its own rows, which
// listed the very edits the band was already carding a few pixels away. Three
// spellings of one arrival, and the third is why nothing short of deletion
// fixed it: the same edit was on the screen twice.
//
// IT ALSO TOOK ITS HEIGHT FROM THE MAP. That block was `flex: none` beside a
// `flex: 1` band, so the band got what the block left — a revision's card,
// capped at 40% of the rail, took that 40% out of the column whose whole job is
// positioning cards against their marks, and clipped the card above it. (Both
// the cap and the budget it defended are gone with the fixed column; what the
// two checks below still assert is the GEOMETRY, which is not.)
//
// So this block asks the two questions deletion is the answer to, and it asks
// them IN THE STATE THE CARD EXISTED IN: a revision asked for, and a revision
// landed. Nothing is asserted about an empty rail — the card never rendered on
// one, and a check that reads a state the bug could not reach is a check that
// cannot fail.
//
// NOTHING IS LOST BY ITS GOING, which is why the claim below is only about the
// language and not about the reach: bulk accept/reject is `✓ all` in the census
// strip over the same population, and stepping through what arrived is `j`/`k`
// through `stepOrder`. Both are asserted elsewhere in this file and in
// motion.mjs.
//
// BEFORE §8a and §8, because both of those end with a review that has been
// sealed, and a sealed server refuses the `galley suggest` this block needs.

  // crossed a 376px gutter; aimed at the card's middle instead it stopped
  // striking horizontally and began sagging diagonally THROUGH the paragraph
  // the reviewer is reading — measured at 250px of sag with the card and its
  // mark 0px apart vertically. The gutter is too wide for a line to cross
  // without being the loudest thing on the page, and the question it answered
  // is answered better by the words changing.

  // AND THE CARD THAT CANNOT POINT. The adrift rule — *a card that cannot point
  // must not be drawn pointing* — is MOOT, and this check is where that is said
  // rather than left as a silence. `connectorGeometryFor` stated it as one of
  // four refusals, in script, after it had been a per-state CSS rule; nothing is
  // drawn now, and a card is adrift exactly when its mark is NOT in the
  // document, so `markRuns` finds nothing to light and the refusal is
  // STRUCTURAL rather than enforced. There is no clause to delete a clause from.
  //
  // WHAT THE OLD CHECK CARRIED BESIDES THAT RULE IS NOT MOOT, which is why this
  // is a rewrite. Hovering a card whose run is not in the prose must light
  // NOTHING — not its own words, which are absent, and not somebody else's.
  //
  // AND IT IS PRODUCED GENUINELY RATHER THAN BY HAND. The old one added
  // `.gly-adrift` to a card whose mark was still in the prose, because the
  // clause under test read the class; with no clause, that would be a synthetic
  // state testing nothing. The real condition is "this card's run is not in the
  // document", and rewriting `data-run` is exactly that condition, deterministic
  // — the websocket race that produces it for real is one frame long and a check
  // that waits for it is a check that flakes.
  //
  // IT ALL HAPPENS INSIDE ONE `evaluate`, and that is the second thing this
  // check had to be taught. `paintRail` rebuilds every card on the pending
  // poll, so a hand-written `data-run` is undone within a second and a half:
  // the first cut set it, called Playwright's `hover`, and Playwright waited
  // for a selector that could only match again once the repaint had put the
  // real run back — so it hovered the restored card and reported the light on.

  // THE CONVERSATION IS NOT DROPPED, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT COULD GO WRONG. It
  // is live work: the census counts it, and the sheet lists it. That is

  //
  // It used to be built before the server started: the comment was filed with
  // `galley suggest --comment --on`, and then the `{==…==}` was taken out from
  // under it by rewriting the .md on disk — which is what a reviewer deleting
  // the text a conversation is about does, without a reviewer. The document is
  // OPEN now and the live document owns the file: an outside write is
  // overwritten by the next projection, and the fixture would be racing the
  // server for it. So the deletion is performed the way the product performs
  // it, in the editor. Deleting a TEXT comment's words now retracts the comment
  // (asserted below), so the unplaced card is made from a BLOCK comment whose
  // mark is deleted, which is the one way the product still makes one.
  //
  // ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED. An editor that could not find the phrase would leave
  // this fixture quietly without an unplaced instruction, and every check below
  // would then be reading zero matches — the pass-forever shape, in the block
  // whose whole subject is a card that cannot point.
  // FILED HERE, NOT IN THE OPENING SEED. The seed's copy of this instruction is
  // GONE by the time this block runs: §9 presses Revise, which SENDS the round —
  // `sendReviewerRound` hands every pending instruction to the agent and clears
  // the list — so the fixture's first six are consumed several hundred lines

// --- §10a · the rail begins BELOW the bar, and nothing lands under it --------

// whatever the anchor pass does not explicitly place lands wherever `top: 0`
// puts it. Absolute takes the rail OUT OF FLOW, so its containing block is the
// initial one and `top: 0` is document y 0: exactly where the opaque sticky bar
// sits at `scrollY 0`, with the rail at `z-index: 5` under it. The regroup
// reasoned that a sticky bar is in flow and therefore already reserves that
// space — true of a flow sibling, false of this element, and §10 above could
// not see the difference because every card it reads is placed by hand.
//
// TWO STATES REACH IT, AND BOTH ARE STATES THE PRODUCT REACHES ON ITS OWN.
//
//   A. THE SETTLED DOCUMENT — the state Court reaches the moment he presses
//      `✓ all`, and his own report restated: *"settled still overrides the rest
//      of the threads. changed then overrides that."* With nothing pending and
//      no open thread, `paintRailCards` appends the settled notice and returns
//      before a single card is built, so `this.cards` is empty, the band is
//      written to height 0, and all three sections stack from the rail's top.
//   B. EVERY CARD ADRIFT — a suggestion the server reports and the document
//      does not show yet, which is what EVERY agent suggestion arriving ahead
//      of the websocket is for the frame before it lands. An adrift card has no
//      anchor, so the anchored loop neither positions it nor counts it into the
//      band's height: `top: auto` is its static position, the band stays 0 tall,
//      and the sections are drawn straight over the cards.
//
// BOTH ARE INSTALLED BY HAND, for §8a's stated reason. Neither is reachable
// without destroying this fixture — A is a swept review, which would leave §8
// below with no verbs to read, and B is a race with the websocket measured in
// frames. The state is written onto the REAL app and painted by the REAL
// `paintRail`, so everything read back is the product's own geometry; the
// fixture is restored by a real `refreshPending` afterwards.
//
// State A keeps the RESOLVED thread — `censusCounts.threads` counts open
// threads only, so a document whose every conversation is settled still reads
// `threads === 0`, which is what puts the settled region and the notice on
// screen together. That is the shape of Court's complaint and not a contrivance

   *  and the rail's own top is beside it: a box whose document top is above the
   *  bar's foot is behind the bar at every scroll position there is, which is
   *  the defect. `reachable` is a hit test, and it is taken with the page
   *  SCROLLED so the box's head sits just below the bar — the §10 standard, "on
   *  screen once you scroll to it", because a card at the end of a 2000px band
   *  is legitimately below the fold and `elementFromPoint` answers `null` for
   *  every point outside the window.
   *
   *  The point read is the box's own TOP edge rather than its centre: a bar
   *  covering the head of a section and leaving its foot is still a head the
   *  reviewer cannot read or press. */
  //
  //  NOTHING HERE HOLDS AN ELEMENT ACROSS AN AWAIT, and that is not caution —
  //  it is a measured hazard. `clearNewLater` fires 8s after the last arrival,
  //  clears the ring on what is new and calls `paintRail`, which destroys and
  //  rebuilds every card. The first version of the hit-test loop captured its
  //  card references once: the rebuild landed between two iterations, every
  //  later rect came back `0` (a detached element measures at the origin) and
  //  every point landed on the bar — a failure that looks exactly like the
  //  defect under test and is not it. A card is re-resolved BY INDEX after
  //  every scroll, which survives the rebuild because the rebuild is from the
  //  same list in the same order.

// A HIDDEN FULL-SCREEN SURFACE THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY HIDDEN COVERS THE DOCUMENT,
// and `[hidden] { display: none }` is a USER-AGENT rule that ANY author
// `display` beats — this panel needs `display: flex` for its own layout, so the
// first cut of it painted over the whole page from load with `hidden` set.
// Nine checks in `just motion` passed over that: a rect is a rect under an
// overlay, and every bar control still answered `elementFromPoint` because the
// bar sits above the panel. The first thing to notice was a drag across the
// prose that selected nothing. So the check is not "the attribute is set" —
// that is the proxy this file records six failures of — it is what the browser
// does with a click at a coordinate over the prose.
//
// And when it IS open, the claim is the other half of the same sentence: it
// covers the prose and it does NOT cover the way back. The bottom bar carries
// the count, the step and the way out at narrow widths, and a record drawn over
// them is the covered-control defect wearing a new coat.

// live one", and it was not last: §12 (the rounds) and §13 (an applied round)
// stood after it, and they ran on a live page because §8 finished by pressing
// `↺ reopen` and handing the review back.
//
// There is no reopen. `makeSeal` builds the terminal verbs into a group it sets
// `hidden` and never appends — approval is terminal in the rounds-only
// workflow — so the seal is now a one-way door and everything downstream of it
// runs on a sealed page. Measured: §12's first `.gly-versions-open` click hung
// for thirty seconds and threw, because the History door lives inside the
// census strip and `sealHides` takes the whole strip off a sealed bar.
//
// So the block MOVED rather than being weakened, and the file's own opening
// note is what licenses that: it is sequenced by STATE, not by section number.
// §8's state is the last one this document reaches.

// --- §8 · the terminal bar: what a sealed review PAINTS ----------------------
//
// LAST, because it ends the review: every section above needs a live one.
//
// PAINT IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER GATE, and the seal adds a whole bar nobody
// else looks at. `just verify` never opens a browser; motion.mjs holds rects
// across a click and a stably-wrong colour survives it untouched; probe.mjs has
// no DOM. Two claims live here and nowhere else. The terminal bar is CHROME —
// it must not paint at the document's size or in the document's colour, which
// is the exact regression the shell's `.gly-bar button` rule shipped once
// already (seven controls at 14px in the accent). And a sealed review's verbs
// must LOOK dead as well as being dead: `disabled` alone is a fact about the
// DOM, and a control that reads live and does nothing is the failure the seal
// exists to remove, moved one layer down.

  // `display === 'none'` is what runs, and it was written `=== 'none' ||

  // tightening is the whole fix: a dead selector reports `absent`, and `absent`
  // is not `none`. The line below it was presented for a while as the guard
  // that catches a dead selector, and it cannot be: `none` already implies
  // `not absent`, so it can only go red in runs where the check above it is
  // already red. It is a NOTE now, which is what this file's own rule says to

  // treatment from their own container rule, and this reads it back off a real
  // card rather than trusting either declaration.
  //
  // IT WAS RAIL-SCOPED AND COULD NOT STAY THAT WAY. This section's approve
  // leaves the document SETTLED — `0 pending`, every thread resolved — and the
  // rail holds live work only, so on the page this check actually runs against
  // the rail is one notice and no cards at all. It used to find verbs there
  // because the rail carried the settled region, and every settled card wears
  // `↺ reopen`, `delete` and a reply box. Those cards are the SHEET's now.
  //
  // So the scope is every surface a card renders on, which is what the claim
  // was always about — and the non-vacuity guard below is what stops that from
  // being a widening that quietly reads nothing. The sheet keeps its last
  // render while hidden, which is why it answers here at all.
  //
  // WHAT A SEALED PAGE CANNOT DO IS OPEN IT, and that is a real cost of the
  // move, stated rather than smoothed over: the seal hides the census strip, so
  // the count — the door to the sheet — goes with it, and a sealed review's
  // settled conversations are not browsable until Reopen. It is coherent
  // rather than merely tolerable: every verb on such a card is dead while
  // sealed (this check is that fact), so there is nothing to do with one, and
  // the single press that changes that is the press that brings the door back.
  //
  // THERE IS NO MITIGATION IN THE PROSE. A settled note used to be marked as
  // settled in the document, by matching its text to a thread; that marker is
  // gone with the text matching, and a note now shows only the words of a
  // PENDING block comment, found by ID. So while the page is sealed a settled
  // conversation has no surface at all, note or range alike. What was SENT is
  // not lost: each sent round's asks (key, words, quote) are in rounds.jsonl.
  // An unsent comment the reviewer deleted, or whose words they deleted, is
  // recorded nowhere, by design.
  // THE SELECTORS ARE THE ONES THE PRODUCT BUILDS, AND ONLY THOSE. This list
  // named six controls that no longer exist — `.gly-card-accept` and
  // `.gly-card-reject` (the proposal card's pair), `.gly-thread-resolve` and
  // `.gly-thread-reply` (the two conversation verbs), on both surfaces — and a
  // group query silently drops what it cannot match, so `dead.length > 0` and
  // `dead.every(disabled)` below were being satisfied by the two verbs that DO
  // exist while reading as coverage of six. That is the vacuous shape this file
  // records six of, in the very block whose job is to catch it: an instruction
  // is immutable work for the next round, so `threadCard` builds edit and

  // `pointer` — correct as far as it goes, and it left the reply box read by no
  // appearance check at all. Every other claim on this page reads the `disabled`
  // FLAG, which the box has always carried. Measured on a real sealed page:
  // `disabled: true`, `opacity: 1`, `background: rgba(0,0,0,0)`, `border:
  // rgb(227,229,236)`, `placeholder: "reply…"` — pixel-identical to the live
  // one two seconds earlier, while `✓ resolve` and `delete` beside it dimmed
  // correctly. A closed review went on asking for a reply.
  //
  // It is three elements and not one, which is why this reads the constant
  // whole rather than the box that was reported: `.gly-bubble/.gly-card/
  // .gly-composer button[disabled]` covers every BUTTON in SEALED_VERBS and
  // nothing covered the three text boxes — `.gly-thread-reply`,
  // `.gly-overall-input` and `.gly-composer-text`. Fixing the reported one and
  // missing the other two is this repository's own pattern.
  //
  // THE CLAIM IS A DIFFERENCE, not a value: whatever the dead vocabulary is,
  // a reviewer must be able to see that the control changed. Reading it as
  // "opacity is 0.55" would pin one treatment and go green the day some other
  // one replaced it; reading it as live-versus-sealed cannot. Both edges are

  // every selector in SEALED_VERBS was enabled again on every surface, that a
  // reopened page could still open the whole-document panel and still place the
  // composer, and — the sharpest of them — that the unseal EDGE itself ran the
  // painters, with the 1500ms tick stubbed out so a `refreshPending` a second
  // later could not rescue the page and be mistaken for the press doing it.
  // That last one was the whole reason §8a exists, and it was shown red by
  // deleting the two `applySeal` repaint calls.
  //
  // `makeSeal` builds `.gly-seal-reopen` and `.gly-seal-done` into a group it
  // sets `hidden` and never appends to the bar: "approval is terminal in the
  // rounds-only workflow", so there is no reopen to press and no editor to stop
  // from the page. A `locator('.gly-seal-reopen').click()` waits thirty seconds
  // for actionability and then throws — an error, not a failing check, which is
  // how this was found.
  //
  // WHAT THE DELETION COSTS IS ON THE RECORD. The invariant SEAL_ONLY_VERBS
  // states — every selector in SEALED_VERBS either has a painter the unseal
  // edge runs, or is in SEAL_ONLY_VERBS and is re-enabled explicitly on that
  // edge — is now asserted on ONE side only: §8 above still reads the whole
  // constant on the SEALED page, so a control the seal fails to kill is still
  // caught, and §8a still holds the live page's own flags. The unseal edge has
  // no gate at all, because the product has no unseal. If a reopen ever
