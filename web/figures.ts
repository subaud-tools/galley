// web/figures.ts owns the ways a reviewer starts an instruction from a PLACE
// rather than from a selection: the block grip beside every heading, fence,
// table, figure, display-math block and front matter, and a figure's region,
// reached from that grip's composer by Mark a region.
//
// It is a MIXIN — an object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto `App.prototype`
// in entry.ts — not a class of its own, so every method here still reads and
// writes `this` on the live App instance (`this.editor`, `this.comments`,
// `this.composer`, `this.grips`, and so on). `this` IS TYPED AGAINST
// `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own header for the
// this-typing decision.
//
// GRIPS WRITE. Do not confuse this file with web/figure.ts (singular), whose
// NodeViews are presentation only and explicitly forbidden from writing —
// see that file's header. This one opens the composer and posts
// instructions; it is a different mechanism on purpose.
//
// THE GRIP'S RULES ARE web/grips.ts's: which blocks get one, what it says,
// and how two crowded grips stack. This file measures, asks, and paints.
//
// THE GRIPS ARE ONE LAYER, A SIBLING OF `.ProseMirror` inside `#editor` and
// never a child of it: anything appended inside `.ProseMirror` is content,
// and the next projection writes it to the author's file. Each grip is
// absolutely positioned, so the layer moves nothing in the document.
//
// A GRIP NEVER TOUCHES THE SELECTION. It used to select its whole block to
// show what the instruction would be about, and the selection outlived the
// composer: the next keystroke replaced the section. The scope is a
// decoration now (web/scope.ts) and the selection stays the reviewer's.
//
// indexOfChild and sectionSpan are private to this module in the sense that
// matters: their callers are among the methods below. sectionSpan is exported
// only because web/probe.mjs tests it directly in isolation.

 * LEVEL-AWARE, NOT "THE NEXT HEADING". An h3 nested under an h2 is part of that
 * h2's section, and stopping at it would outline the first paragraph of a
 * section the reviewer can plainly see is longer — and then open a thread about
 * that paragraph, labelled with the heading. A wrong anchor that looks right is
 * the failure this whole line of work exists to remove.
 *
 * Top-level only, which is the same cut suggest.Blocks makes on the Go side: a
 * heading nested in a list item or a blockquote is not an addressable block
 * there, so a grip beside it would have no key to file a thread against.
 *
 * Returns null for a position that is not a top-level heading, so a caller
 * cannot accidentally treat a paragraph as a section.
 *
 * `headingPos` is the position BEFORE the heading node.
