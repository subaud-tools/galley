// wire.d.ts — THE GO↔JS CONTRACT, GENERATED. DO NOT EDIT.
//
// Written by internal/serve/wire_test.go from the json tags of the five view
// structs that ARE the wire: PendingView and InstructionView
// (internal/serve/editmode.go), roundView, diffView and changeView
// (internal/serve/versions.go), plus every struct they reach — including
// across a package boundary, which is how suggest.BlockRef and review.Region
// get here. A named string type with a Values() method is an enum, declared
// as a union of its values: tools-common's msgstate.State is MessageState.
//
// Regenerate with `just wire`. A drift between this file and the Go
// structs fails `just verify`, which is Go-only and therefore runs on every
// machine, in CI and in the pre-push hook, whether or not node is installed.
// That is the whole point of it: the rename of `pending.suggestions` to
// `pending.instructions` broke two browser gates and went unnoticed for
// weeks, because the only things that could see it were scripts nobody ran.
//
// READING THE OPTIONALITY, because it is stated honestly rather than
// conveniently:
//
//   - `x?: T` — the Go field carries `omitempty`, so the key is ABSENT from
//     the payload when it is the zero value. An absent slice is not an empty
//     one and is not null.
//   - `x: T[] | null` — no `omitempty`, so a nil slice is serialized as JSON
//     `null`. The type says so rather than promising an array: `|| []` at the
//     reader is load-bearing, and a declaration that hid this would make the
//     one line protecting against it look like superstition.
//   - a `time.Time` is a string. It is not a shape on the wire.
