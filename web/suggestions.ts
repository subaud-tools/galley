// suggestions.ts — the browser half of galley's suggestion grammar: the
// guard over literal regions, the machinery that locates an AGENT's proposal
// in the document, and the bubble that says what a mark is.
//
// Two pieces, one file because they are two halves of one idea:
//
//   suggestionPlugin  refuses edits to literal regions (fences, tables,
//                     inline code) with a reason the UI can show. It no
//                     longer converts reviewer keystrokes into anything: the
//                     reviewer's edits apply DIRECTLY, the way every editor
//                     edits a document (the reviewer's-hand cut,
//                     docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-the-reviewers-hand.md).
//                     Only the AGENT's proposals are tracked, and they arrive
//                     server-stamped through the websocket.
//   SuggestionUI      turns a click on an ins/del/highlight mark into a
//                     bubble that says what the mark is. It offers no
//                     verdict: accept and reject are gone (see render).
//
// The second half never touches the document. Every mark is written by the
// server, which rebuilds the whole fragment, and the change arrives here over
// the websocket like any other edit.
//
// WHAT USED TO LIVE HERE, and why it is gone rather than hidden. The plugin
// converted every reviewer keystroke into a tracked mark — ins for typing,
// del-re-insertion for deleting — attributed 'court' and stamped with a
// browser-minted run (`newRun`, the stamper that was twice claimed and absent;
// web/typing.mjs exists because of it). The reviewer's-hand decision retired
// that whole layer: a change the reviewer makes deliberately is a change the
// reviewer approved, so pending is purely the agent's proposals and nothing
// the reviewer does to the document ever waits on the reviewer. typing.mjs
// was kept and repurposed to assert the new contract — a real keystroke
// produces NO mark, clean text, and an unchanged pending count.

// --- a code fence is READ-ONLY ---
//
// PHASE-1 POLICY, in one place because leaving it implicit produced three
// separate bugs in the same afternoon. A fenced code block cannot be edited in
// this editor at all: not typed into, not deleted from, not joined with the
// block above or below it.
//
// The reason is not squeamishness about code, it is that there is nowhere to
// RECORD such an edit. Fenced content is literal and galley must never rewrite
// one (CLAUDE.md says so at length); ProseMirror will not carry a mark inside a
// `code: true` node, so `ins`/`del` have no representation there; and per-line
// code suggestions are a phase-3 mechanism with a syntax of their own. Every
// path that edited a fence anyway wrote something nobody could review:
//
//   - Backspace at position 0 of a fence is a cross-block JOIN, which this
//     plugin's documented limitation applies as a real, untracked deletion. The
//     codeBlock node vanished, its text was lifted into the paragraph before
//     it, and the next projection wrote CriticMarkup litter into the author's
//     .md. Destructive, unrecoverable except from git, recorded nowhere.
//   - typing inside a fence reached the file as real text with nothing in
//     /_galley/pending: `tr.addMark` silently does nothing where the mark is
//     disallowed, so the fence was half-editable — insertions applied for real
//     and unreviewably, deletions silently no-oped.
//   - Backspace inside a fence re-inserted what it removed, unmarked. Nothing
//     was lost, but the caret walked one position left per press while the
//     document never changed.
//
// So the honest phase-1 behaviour is refusal, and refusal that SAYS SO — see
// the plugin's onRefused. Nothing here touches the DOM or the selection: only
// transactions that would CHANGE a fence are stopped, so reading, selecting,
// copying and scrolling through one all still work exactly as before.
//
// THE REVIEWER'S-HAND CUT KEPT THIS GUARD DELIBERATELY. The "nowhere to
// RECORD it" half of the rationale died with reviewer tracking — nothing of
// the reviewer's is recorded now — but the other half stands on its own: a
// fence is literal text galley never rewrites, the destroyed-fence join above
// was a real loss, and per-line code editing is a phase-3 mechanism with a
// syntax of its own. Lifting the refusal is a product decision to be made on
// purpose, not a side effect of the cut.

// The two reasons a change is refused, spelled out for whoever has to read them
// on screen. Exported so the UI cannot drift into its own wording.

//
// So it RENDERS, and every edit to it is refused — the same cut as the fence
// and the table, in the same voice. It is asked BEFORE the fence question in

// --- inline `code` is literal too, and it is a MARK, not a region ---
//
// THE SAME RULE ONE LEVEL DOWN, WHERE THE MACHINERY ABOVE CANNOT SEE IT.
// literalRegion asks a NODE question and literalHit walks nodesBetween; a
// fence and a table are nodes, so both are found. Inline `code` is a MARK on
// text inside a paragraph, so it never appears in that walk — and StarterKit's
// code mark is `excludes: '_'`, which makes ProseMirror's Mark.addToSet refuse
// to put `ins` or `del` on code text at all. The suggestion mark is not split
// there; it is never applied. So the fence's second and third breaches were
// live here, verbatim, with no guard:
//
//   - typing inside a code span reached the file with nothing in
//     /_galley/pending — under tracked typing, an edit the contract never saw,
//     projected into the author's .md;
//   - deleting inside one was a silent no-op: the text removed and re-inserted
//     unmarked, the document byte-identical, only the caret moved.
//
// (Both breaches are described in the tracked-typing world that found them;
// the guard outlived that world because inline code is literal text galley
// never rewrites, the same standing reason the fence keeps.)
//
// ONLY `inside`, AND THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A fence refuses a JOIN
// as well, because a join destroys a fence. A mark has no boundary to be
// merged across, and an edit running from prose THROUGH a code span into prose
// is the reviewer deleting a sentence that happens to contain a code word:
// "The `retryBudget` value controls". That must keep working. Refusing it would
// mean a reviewer cannot delete a phrase because of one word inside it — an
// obstruction they meet constantly, and a loud obstruction met constantly is a
// worse product than a silent bug met rarely.
//
// WHAT CROSSING USED TO COST, closed by the reviewer's-hand cut rather than
// by the schema decision everyone expected. Under tracked typing the code
// word's own deletion was recorded nowhere (`excludes: '_'` kept `del` off
// it), so accepting the card left the word in the file — Gap 6, symptom 1.
// A direct deletion has no card and no re-insert: the crossing deletes the

 *
 * The arithmetic, since off-by-one here is the whole game — and the two cases
 * differ, exactly as they do for a fence:
 *
 *   a removal or replacement (hi > lo) is inside when the range lies wholly
 *   within one run: [run.pos, run.end]. Deleting the whole run counts; a code
 *   span is not editable and that includes being editable to zero. ONE prose
 *   character anywhere in the range makes it a CROSSING, which is accepted —
 *   that is the reviewer deleting a phrase, not editing the code.
 *
 *   an insertion (hi === lo) is inside only when the caret is STRICTLY within,
 *   run.pos < lo < run.end. At either boundary the caret sits between prose and
 *   code, and typing in that gap is not typing in the span.
 *
 * A MEASURED RESIDUAL AT THE TRAILING BOUNDARY, recorded rather than refused.
 * ProseMirror's ResolvedPos.marks() takes the marks of the node BEFORE the
 * caret and `code` is inclusive, so text typed at exactly run.end lands
 * code-marked — new prose rendered and serialized as code. (Under tracked
 * typing this also made it unmarkable and therefore untracked; direct
 * application removed that half of the defect and left the cosmetic half.)
 * Refusing it would mean a reviewer cannot type after a code word that ends a
 * paragraph, which is precisely the wall this rule exists to avoid; the honest
 * fix is a schema decision about what `code` excludes. Pinned in probe.mjs.

 *
 * THE REGIONS ARE ASKED FIRST, and the mark only when they come up empty. A

 * code cannot be inside either of them anyway (a codeBlock's spec.marks is '').
 *
 * The arithmetic, since off-by-one here is the whole game. A fence node
 * occupies [pos, end); its literal text is [pos + 1, end - 1).
 *
 *   a removal or replacement (to > from) rewrites the fence when its range
 *   overlaps the NODE, not merely the node's text: the backspace that destroys
 *   a fence removes [pos - 1, pos + 1] and takes out no fenced character at all
 *   — it removes the boundary that makes the fence a fence. Deleting the
 *   whole node counts too; a fence is not editable and that includes being
 *   editable to zero.
 *
 *   an insertion (to === from) rewrites it only when the caret is strictly
 *   INSIDE the node — pos + 1 (the very start of the text, which is where the
 *   destructive backspace was reported from) up to end - 1. Typing at pos or
 *   at end is typing in the gap between two blocks, which is not the fence's
 *   business.
 *
 * A code hit carries no `node` (a mark is not one) and is never a `join` — see

 * suggestionPlugin is the guard over literal regions, and ONLY that.
 *
 * It used to be the tracked-changes converter — every local insertion picked
 * up an `ins` mark, every deletion was re-inserted `del`-marked, both
 * attributed to the reviewer and stamped with a browser-minted run, all in an
 * appendTransaction that mapped positions through the batch. The
 * reviewer's-hand cut removed that whole layer: the reviewer's edits apply
 * directly, so there is nothing to convert, nothing to attribute and nothing
 * to stamp. What remains is the one thing filtering was always right for —
 * refusing an edit whose correct outcome is that nothing happens.
 *
 * CODE FENCES, TABLES AND INLINE `code` are refused outright, in
 * filterTransaction — see literalHit. A code span is refused only where the
 * change falls wholly INSIDE it; one that runs through it is a deletion of
 * the prose around it and applies like any other. The cost of "no" alone (an
 * editor that feels broken) is paid off by onRefused, which is called with
 * the region and a reason so the UI can say why.
 *
 * Everything else — typing, deleting, pasting, IME composition, cross-block
 * deletion, formatting, structure — passes through untouched and applies the
 * way ProseMirror applies it. The agent's proposals are unaffected: they are
 * made server-side, stamped server-side, and arrive through the websocket as
 * remote changes this plugin has never touched.

//
// The fallback below is a genuine MATCH rather than an identity, and is what
// this function used to be entirely: (kind, text, author) are the three things
// both sides can see without an id. `at` is deliberately not among them,
// because the server reports it rounded to a second through JSON and a
// mismatch there would silently anchor nothing. It still runs for a mark that
// predates the id — one loaded from a document the current session did not
// mint — and callers must still handle ambiguity themselves (the bubble
// refuses; the panel shows the first and says so).
// AND A SUBSTITUTION IS ADDRESSABLE BY EITHER HALF, because the reviewer can
// click either half. One span in the file is one decision everywhere — but in
// the FRAGMENT it is a Del and an Ins with two runs (markdown's applyMark runs
// once per half and correctly stamps each), and the wire's `run` is the deleted
// half's, deliberately and for good reasons stated in suggest.substitutionSpan.
// So a click on the GREEN half carried a run that matched nothing: the bubble
// found zero candidates, guessed "the server has not seen this one yet", and
// offered no verbs — about `s1`, one of the three pending, whose card sat 400px
// to the right with a working ✓ accept. One edit read as three different things
// depending on where the cursor landed.
//
// `insRun` is the OTHER HALF'S ADDRESS, carried on the wire by the side that
// computed the pairing (suggest.Pending.InsRun). It is read here and nowhere
// else, and reading it is NOT re-deriving the pairing — that rule is
// markdown.planSubstitution's, it is why the file says `{~~…~>…~~}` at all, and
// a heuristic here ("a del run followed by an ins run") would be the second
// spelling this codebase has paid for twice. The decision is still addressed by
// `run`: whichever half was clicked, `decide` posts the deleted half's, exactly
// as the card does.
// A suggestion as either side of sameSuggestion sees it — the server's own
// pending entry, a MARK run read out of the document (see markRuns), or

   * screen", not "is the window narrow". A thread drawn here while the rail is
   * drawing it too is one conversation in two places, each with its own reply
   * box and its own delete. So where the rail IS carrying it, the click does
   * the only useful thing left: it takes the reviewer to the card — the same
   * reveal() the card already offers in the other direction — and opens no
   * bubble at all. Where the rail is NOT (below the breakpoint, or collapsed at
   * any width, which railSurfaces answers and a width test would get wrong),
   * the bubble IS where the conversation lives and it carries the whole card,
   * reply box and both verbs included.
   *
   * A comment mark with no thread to show falls through to the two-verb bubble,
   * which now renders as a head and an honest note: there is nothing to decide
   * on a conversation and nothing to read either.

   * THE TWO PLACEMENTS DIFFER ON PURPOSE — do not unify them. A two-verb bubble
   * is three lines about the mark and sits ABOVE it: it covers the line before
   * the one under discussion and leaves that one readable. A CONVERSATION is a
   * whole card — a head, every reply, a reply box and two verbs — and above the
   * mark a card that tall covers the sentence the conversation is about, which
   * is the one sentence the reviewer needs to read while answering it. So a
   * thread HANGS BELOW, and the prose it is about stays above it, uncovered.
   *
   * The fallback when a thread does not FIT below is `above` — the two-verb
   * placement — rather than a below clamped up into the viewport. A clamped
   * below is drawn OVER the mark, which is the single outcome both placements
   * exist to avoid; above still leaves the sentence uncovered, and roomFor has
   * already made sure it fits there.
   *
   * BOTH CLAMP TO THE READABLE BAND, NOT TO THE WINDOW. The top bar is sticky
   * over the head of the page and the narrow layout's bottom bar is fixed over
   * its foot; a card clamped to the window is drawn over one of them — measured,
   * with a conversation covering `✓ all`, `✗ all` and the whole-doc handle. The
   * clamps still fire despite roomFor, because a card has a minimum height of
   * its own (a head, a two-row reply box and two verbs) that a short enough
   * window cannot honour.
