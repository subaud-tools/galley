// web/bar.ts owns the bar's chrome: the status readout, the census strip,
// which surfaces are on screen at this width, and the mode toggle.
//
// It is a MIXIN — an object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto `App.prototype`
// in entry.ts — not a class of its own, so every method here still reads and
// writes `this` on the live App instance exactly as it did before the move
// (`this.status`, `this.census`, `this.bar`, `this.modeUI`, and so on). `this`
// IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own header
// for the this-typing decision.
//
// THIS IS WHAT REMAINS OF THE BAR once History (web/history.ts), the primary
// action (makeRevise, now in web/verdict.ts) and the seal have their own homes:
// the status line, the census, the surfaces decision, and the mode switch.
// paintSurfaces is the second-most behaviour-dense method in the file after
// paintAnchors — it is the ONLY place any of the three surfaces is shown or
// hidden, so every other piece of code sets state and calls it rather than
// touching `hidden` itself.
//
// The mode vocabulary — MODE_ASK, MODE_LIVE, modeLabel, modeOn, modeTitle,
// nextMode — and the readout's phase vocabulary — PHASE_DRAFT, PHASE_AGENT,
// PHASE_SETTLED, roundPhrase, HANDOFF_NOTE_HELD — move here with the methods
// that are their only callers. entry.ts's constructor still reads MODE_ASK
// to seed `this.mode`, and imports it back from here — the same shape as
// every other mixin wiring, not a cycle: bar.ts never imports from entry.ts.

    // that had just clicked the switch. A second click there would have held
    // the arrivals the reviewer was turning on. The general rule is Court's:
    // a click must never move the thing it landed on, or the thing beside it.
    //
    // So the space is RESERVED and only the visibility is toggled — see
    // paintMode. And because hold's own label changes on its own click
    // (`⏸ hold` becomes `▶ release · 0`, which is wider), the two labels are
    // stacked in ONE grid cell: the button is always as wide as the wider of
    // them, so the swap cannot change its box either. That is exact rather
