// it: threadCard — head, entries, edit/delete verbs, and its bubble and
// overall-card wearings — and paintAnchors, the placement pass that puts
// every card beside its own mark or block, in document coordinates.
// It is a MIXIN — an object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto
// `App.prototype` in entry.ts — not a class of its own, so every method
// here still reads and writes `this` on the live App instance exactly as
// it did before the move (`this.cards`, `this.rail`, `this.overall`,
// `this.comments`, `this.blocks`, `this.editor`, `this.sheetOpen`, and
// so on). `this` IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that
// file's own header for the this-typing decision.
//
// blockElement and blockTop are private to this module: they were free
// functions in entry.ts with exactly two callers, paintAnchors and
// revealBlock, and both moved here with them.
//
// draftRoots STAYS in entry.ts — it reads `this.overall.root` off the
// live instance, which the shared prototype makes safe from any module.

  // IT ANSWERED R7 IN THE ONE PLACE THAT COULD NOT HOLD IT. The rail holds live
  // work only — *here is what needs you, beside the text it is about* — and a
  // `+ add` button needs nothing and is beside nothing. It was chrome standing
  // in the work column, and that placement caused BOTH of Court's reported
  // defects at once: it scrolled out of reach on any document longer than a
  // screen (the rail is `position: absolute` in the PAGE, so its first card is
  // reachable at exactly one scroll position), and opening it slid every
  // anchored card 39.29px off its mark, because `paintAnchors` floors every
  // card at the band's own top and the band no longer started at the rail's
  // top. Three better placements were proposed and all three were wrong for the
  // same reason; the button did not need a better place in the rail, it needed
  // to not be in the rail.
  //
  // SO CAPTURE IS CHROME NOW — a control in the bar beside `Instructions`,
  // `History` and `Revise`, and a right-click in the document (web/menu.ts) —
  // and the TYPING happens in `makeCaptureCard`'s card, which is in the rail
  // because an instruction being written IS live work. What is left here is the
  // filed threads, which were always live work and always belonged.
  //

  //   · NOTHING IN FLOW CHANGES WHEN IT OPENS. The band's top is where it was,
  //     so every anchored card is still on its mark. That is §3's 39.29px,
  //     gone by construction rather than by a re-measure.
  //   · IT IS DRAWN AT THE VIEWPORT, not at the rail's top, and its `top` is
  //     computed from `chromeFrame()` — the bar's MEASURED height, never a
  //     constant, because the bar folds. That is §13: reachable at any scroll
  //     position, because it is placed against the window rather than against
  //     the document.
  //   · IT COVERS THE CARDS UNDER IT. A disclosure covers; it does not push.
  //     The band already accepts sliding over overlapping as a stated trade,
  //     and a box the reviewer is typing into is the one box allowed to win.
  //
  // It does not follow the scroll while open, deliberately, and that is the
  // same contract the composer popover has: a surface that chases the viewport
  // while somebody types in it is a surface that moves under the caret.
