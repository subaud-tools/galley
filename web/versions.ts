// versions.ts — History, which is a READING MODE and not a second application.
//
// THIS SURFACE COMPUTES NOTHING. The diff, the region ordinals, the change
// count and the join between an ask and the agent's note about it all come off
// the server already decided, because there is one implementation of each and
// it is Go's. A second one in the browser would agree on every document anyone
// tried and disagree on the one that mattered — the shape this codebase has
// paid for repeatedly (a run stamped in two places, a pairing re-derived across
// a wire, six agreeing spellings and one silence).
//
// IT COVERS, IT DOES NOT DISPLACE. `body.gly-history-mode` hides `main`; this
// section lives in `body` and never inside `.ProseMirror`, because anything
// appended in there is content and the next projection writes it to the
// author's file. Esc closes it, nothing about it traps focus, and the draft's
// scroll position is put back on the way out.
//
// TWO STAGES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE DRAFT WEARING DIFF MARKS.
//
//   - THE LANDING is the current document, plain, beside a rail of round cards
//     newest first. It answers "what has happened to this document", and it
//     answers it in the document's own type, because a reader who has to
//     re-learn a typeface to read their own file has been handed a second
//     product rather than a second view of the first one.
//   - THE READING STATE is one round: the same paper, the same measure, the
//     same 17px/1.7, wearing the marks of that round; and one card per change,
//     carrying the ask that produced it above the agent's own sentence about
//     it. History used to ship a second typography (15px/1.6, a 46rem measure)
//     and it is DELETED — see the stylesheet, where the argument is repeated
//     next to the rules that would otherwise be written again.
//
// THE HISTORY IS ONE LIST AND THEN IT STOPS. Squashing, grouping, filtering and
// a timeline were all considered by the spec and are recorded there as
// DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT: the history is insurance, it is unlikely to be read,
// and building a browsing surface against a list nobody opens is how a phase
// spends itself. A live hour can produce forty rounds; the record stays correct
// and stops being pleasant, and that is the trade, taken on purpose.

// VIEWS are the server's own two, in the order the reader is offered them. The
// labels are the sub-bar's own lowercase mono, which is the prototype's — a
// chip in the chrome layer never converses and never capitalises.
// ONE RAIL. The stack, the gap, the gutter and the breakpoint are the
// INSTRUCTION rail's, imported rather than re-spelled — see web/card.ts's
// header for what the second spelling of each of them cost. `stackCards` is the
// same arithmetic `paintAnchors` uses; the card anatomy and the reveal are the

  // --- alignment ---
  //
  // A CARD SITS BESIDE ITS MARK, and where two cards want one place the lower
  // one gives way. THIS IS `paintAnchors`, ONE SURFACE OVER, AND IT USED TO BE
  // A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION OF IT. `align()` is deleted; what it did wrong is
  // worth recording, because every item was a real difference in behaviour and
  // none of them was a decision anybody took:
  //
  //   IT DID NOT SORT. `stackCards` sorts by `anchorTop` and says why; this
  //   walked the cards in the order the server listed them and pushed each one
  //   below the last. That is only the same answer while the change list is
  //   MONOTONIC in page position — and a moved sentence, a table cell, or any
  //   region whose mark measures above its predecessor's breaks it: the first
  //   card takes a floor the second can never climb back above, so the second
  //   is drawn arbitrarily far below the words it is about, permanently.
  //
  //   AND THAT ORDER IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL — internal/diff says so itself, in
  //   renderSideBySide's own header: a move earns its ordinal at its DELETION
  //   (RegionOps skips the inserted half, because the sentence moved once), and
  //   `renderFlow` stamps BOTH ends with that one ordinal, so the element this
  //   lookup resolves — querySelector's FIRST match in document order — is the
  //   ARRIVAL end wherever a sentence moved earlier in the file. The ordinal
  //   therefore comes from where the sentence WAS and the mark from where it
  //   IS, and nothing makes those two orders agree. That file names this file's
  //   `align()` and `pick()` by name as the readers of it. NOTE, HONESTLY: no
  //   fixture in the tree exhibits it, so no check here has been shown red on
  //   it — the sort is right on the argument, and a check written over a state
  //   nothing reaches would be one of the six this repository already records.
  //
  //   IT INTERLEAVED READS AND WRITES. `card.style.top = …` invalidates layout
  //   and the next iteration's `getBoundingClientRect` forces it back — one
  //   reflow per card, in a loop, on every render and every resize frame.
  //   `paintAnchors` measures everything, then places everything, and states
  //   that as its reason.
  //
  //   IT WROTE A ROUNDED TOP AND CARRIED THE UNROUNDED ONE FORWARD, so what was
  //   on screen and what the next card was placed against disagreed by up to
  //   half a pixel each time, compounding down the column. Nothing is rounded
  //   now: the arithmetic is exact and the browser lays out sub-pixel anyway.
  //
  //   IT WROTE THE HEIGHT UNCONDITIONALLY, with a trailing gap included, on
  //   every call — dirtying layout to say what it already said. `setCardsHeight`
  //   compares first, the way `setBandHeight` does.
  //
  //   IT READ THE BREAKPOINT BACK OUT OF THE STYLESHEET. `getComputedStyle` on
  //   the container, to ask whether the media query had taken it out of
  //   `relative`, was a seventh spelling of 992 AND a forced style recalc. The
  //   question "is the rail beside the paper" has one answer in this codebase
  //   and it is `RAIL_MIN_WIDTH`, which is what `railSurfaces` asks.
  //
  //   AND IT RAN AT RENDER AND ON RESIZE AND NOWHERE ELSE. CLAUDE.md: *"A
  //   CARD'S HEIGHT IS NOT A CONSTANT, so nothing may be stacked against a
  //   measurement and then left there."* A card here grows for the same reasons
  //   one in the draft does — a long ask wrapping when the window narrows, a
  //   web font arriving after first paint — and every card below a grown one
  //   was left stale with nothing to catch it. `cardSizes` is the guard that
  //   entry states as the precondition for this shape being safe at all, and it
  //   is safe from feeding itself for the same stated reason: this pass writes
