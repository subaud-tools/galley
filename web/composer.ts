// web/composer.ts owns the one popover a reviewer types an instruction
// into — the bar, its deny line, the form, and the note — and everything
// that decides where it sits: placeComposerButton (show/hide/keep off the
// current selection), placeComposer (the below-or-flipped-above arithmetic),
// headComposer (the `INSTRUCTION · ON "…"` head), and the two sends,
// sendComment and fileBlockComment, both POSTing to /_galley/instruct.
// It also owns the refusal note — makeRefusal, refuse, paintRefusal,
// dismissRefusal, pulseFence, hideRefusal — which reads and writes
// `composer.deny` directly, and is grouped here rather than with the bar's
// status line for exactly that reason.
// It is a MIXIN — an object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto
// `App.prototype` in entry.ts — not a class of its own, so every method
// here still reads and writes `this` on the live App instance exactly as
// it did before the move (`this.composer`, `this.editor`, `this.refusal`,
// `this.sealed`, and so on). `this` IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell`
// (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own header for the this-typing
// decision.
//
// composerPlacement and docRange are private to this module: composerPlacement
// was a free function in entry.ts with exactly one caller, placeComposerButton,
// and docRange, in turn, was called only from composerPlacement. Both moved
// here with their one caller. sectionSpan lives in web/figures.ts with the
// block grip, which opens a section's composer.

 * job left is to say it in a vocabulary internal/suggest shares.
 *
 * Two details that are not arbitrary. Offsets are RUNES, matching
 * suggest.plainText and markdown.InlineComment.Offset rather than JavaScript's

 * every offset after it. And the path counts the same nesting docmodel.Walk
 * does, which holds because the ProseMirror schema deliberately uses
 * docmodel's own node names.
 *
 * A SELECTION THAT SPANS BLOCKS CARRIES `toPath`, and until now it carried
 * nothing at all. This returned null for one, the composer fell back to sending
 * the selected TEXT, and the server searched for that text inside single blocks
 * — the concatenation of two paragraphs is in neither, so `findUnique` reported
