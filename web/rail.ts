 * stackCards places every card at its anchor's vertical position, pushing a

 *
 * COLLISION ARITHMETIC, AND A FLOOR THE BAND ITSELF SETS. Two marks a few
 * pixels apart need their cards pushed apart, and that is most of what this
 * does.
 *
 * THE CEILING CAME BACK, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT FROM THE ONE THAT WENT.
 * It was deleted with the fold, on the reasoning that "the band starts at the
 * rail's own top, so a card at its mark is simply at its mark" — TRUE OF A RAIL
 * WHOSE FIRST CHILD IS THE BAND, and false the moment anything is pinned above
 * it. The whole-document instruction is a full card pinned FIRST in the rail
 * now (spec §2.2), so the band begins some way down the column while the mark
 * in the document's first paragraph is still near the page's top — and a card
 * placed at that mark is placed at a NEGATIVE band-local top, i.e. drawn over
 * the pinned card. Measured: the first anchored card's head sat on top of the
 * whole-document card's `delete`, and Playwright refused the click with
 * `.gly-card-head … intercepts pointer events`, which is this repository's own
 * "a rect inside the window is not a control the reviewer can press".
 *
 * `ceiling` is therefore the band's own measured top, in the same document
 * coordinates as every anchorTop, and it is the initial floor rather than a
 * per-card clamp — clamping each card independently would pile every early
 * mark's card at exactly the ceiling, on top of each other, which is the
 * collision this function exists to prevent.
 *
 * THE COORDINATES ARE THE DOCUMENT'S. `anchorTop` is a position in the page,
 * not in the window — the caller adds `window.scrollY` to what `coordsAtPos`
 * measures — so nothing here changes when the reader scrolls, and a mark
 * "above the viewport" is not a case this function has. A negative anchorTop
 * would now mean a mark above the document's own top, which does not exist.
 *
 * The sort is inside rather than assumed: the caller builds cards from
 * /_galley/pending, which is in DOCUMENT order, and document order is not
 * always the order marks measure in — a thread card is built after every
 * suggestion card whatever its mark's position. Array.prototype.sort is stable
 * (ES2019), so two marks that measure to the same top keep document order
 * between them.
 *
 * @param ceiling the highest document position a card may take

 * `collapsed` comes back out because narrow FORCES it — the caller must paint
 * the collapsed layout without having to re-derive why.
 *
 * THE SHEET IS NOT A NARROW-ONLY SURFACE ANY MORE, and that is this function's
 * one real change. It used to answer `sheet: false` at every width at or above
 * RAIL_MIN_WIDTH, which was correct while the rail carried a settled region of
 * its own: the sheet was the narrow layout's REPLACEMENT for the rail, so it

 * `s.kind !== 'comment'` here — is a SECOND RULE THAT AGREES FOR NOW, and this
 * codebase has already paid for that shape twice (the serializer's pairing,

 * claimed the browser owned).
 *
 * It was written because the browser had no rule at all where it needed one:
 * `arrivals.ts`'s `batchRows` paired a revision's runs against the whole

 * comment's run under the revision receipt's ✓ — measured accepting a

 * own cards), and this predicate is NOT. It was never the card's — it is the
 * server's answer, and three surfaces still read it, below.
 *
 * ABSENT MEANS NO, deliberately. A payload with no `decidable` field is a
 * payload this bundle was not built against; the bundle and the server ship in
 * one binary, so that cannot happen in a session — and if it somehow does, a
 * verb withheld is recoverable and a verb offered on a conversation is not.
 *
 * THAT JUSTIFICATION IS THIS SIDE'S AND DOES NOT TRAVEL. It rests on the bundle
 * and the server being one binary, which is true of the browser and false of
 * the CLI: `galley accept --all` was a separate process asking whatever `galley
 * edit` was running, with no version handshake in the protocol, so a newer CLI
 * against an older server really did see the field absent, and there absent
 * meant ASK THE KIND. A reader of this field outside the browser has to decide
 * the question again.
 *
 * WHAT IT GOVERNS IS WHAT IS OFFERED. Every surface that puts a ✓ or a ✗ in
 * front of the reviewer, or that `a`/`r` can land on, asks this: the rail's

/* --- what the reviewer is about to tell the agent ---------------------------
 *
 * THE TRAIL IS AN OUTGOING MESSAGE, NOT A HISTORY, AND THAT IS WHY IT HAS NO
 * BROWSABLE SURFACE. This is the reframe from the 2026-08-16 spec and it is the
 * part that has to survive, because every future proposal to give the trail a
 * home will arrive sounding reasonable.
 *
 * `cmd/galley/agentprompt.go` tells the paired session, verbatim: *"The pending
 * view's `changes` are the reviewer's own direct edits — decided facts to read
 * as context, never things to relitigate or re-propose against."* `galley
 * pending` prints them, and `/_galley/pending` carries them. So the trail's
 * audience is THE AGENT. The ghosts in the prose are the visible form of an
 * outgoing message — when the reviewer strikes a phrase and presses the verdict
 * button, the agent is told they did, without which it may re-propose the
 * phrasing just removed.
 *
 * Which fixes WHEN it is wanted, and there are exactly two moments: just after
 * typing (*did that land* — answered by the ghost appearing, in seconds) and
 * just before sending (*what am I about to tell the agent* — answered here).
 * After that git has it and the ledger has it, and NOBODY BROWSES IT.
 *
 * A rail section, a sheet section, a bar cell with a popover, a gutter and a
 * focus mode were all considered and all rejected, and they failed for one
 * reason: they answered WHERE. The question was WHEN. So the count goes on the
 * button that sends it, and any future proposal for a history drawer has to
 * answer when the reviewer would open it before it says where it would live.
 *
 * IT IS THE POPULATION THE AGENT IS SENT, READ RATHER THAN RE-DERIVED. Both
 * numbers come off the SAME pending payload the agent's `galley pending` renders
 * from — `changes` for the edits, the reviewer-authored entries of `comments`
 * for the replies — so the label cannot become a second spelling that agrees
 * for now. In particular the edits number is NOT the browser's own live trail
 * (trailPluginKey's entries): that list runs ahead of the server by one debounce
 * and is not yet anything the agent could be told. What the server holds is what
 * the agent gets, and what the agent gets is what the button counts.
 */

/* `outgoingCounts`, `outgoingLabel`, `OUTGOING_JOIN`, `OUTGOING_EDITS` and
 * `OUTGOING_REPLIES` ARE DELETED — the reframe above is not, and it is the half
 * that had to survive.
 *
 * They reduced the pending payload to `· 6 edits, 2 replies` for a reserved box
 * on the verdict button. Both numbers came off fields the rounds-only wire does
 * not carry: `pendingView` is `{instructions, blocks}`, so `view.changes` was
 * always `undefined` and the reviewer-authored `comments` entries went with the
 * conversation verbs. `.gly-revise-trail`, the box they were written into, was
 * deleted when the words stopped being written; nothing has called either
 * function since, and probe.mjs was checking their arithmetic against no caller
 * at all — the shape this repository has recorded six of.
 *
 * THE COUNT ON THE BUTTON THAT SENDS IT IS STILL THE DESIGN. It is
 * `reviseCountClause(pendingCount)` in `.gly-revise-count` now — one number, the
 * instructions in the round, read off the same payload `galley pending` renders
 * — and the argument for the reserved box is unchanged and lives on that class.

// line counting whatever the cap kept out of them. Every one of them existed
// to manage the overflow that `position: fixed` on `.gly-rail` guaranteed: a
// viewport-locked column holding unbounded content. The rail is as tall as the
// document now and scrolls with it, so work below the window is reached by
// scrolling to it, the bar's census is the ONE readout of what is outstanding,
// and there is nothing left to clamp, dim, cap or count.
//
// `dimCard` went with them, and its absence is load-bearing rather than
// incidental: it was the other writer of the accept/reject/resolve/delete
// `disabled` flags, so the seal is now their sole owner — see SEALED_VERBS in
// entry.ts, whose invariant this makes easier to hold rather than harder.

// --- what the reviewer was in the middle of typing ---

/**
 * carryDrafts decides what to put back into a rebuilt card, and it exists
 * because the rail is rebuilt from scratch on every pending refresh — the 1.5s
 * poll and every mutation, INCLUDING the agent's own reply landing.
 *
 * A half-typed reply is destroyed with the card it was typed into. The
 * codebase already knew this hazard and answered it once: the overall thread
 * was given its own slot so that "a poll that rebuilt this would take the
 * caret out of a sentence someone was in the middle of writing". Thread cards
 * never got the same protection, and in live mode the loop closes — answering
 * a reviewer is what wipes what they are writing back.
 *
 * The unit of identity is the FIELD KEY, not the element and not an ordinal: a
 * card is a different DOM node after every repaint, and its position in the
 * rail renumbers whenever a thread above it resolves (see CLAUDE.md — an
 * ordinal is not identity). A reply field is keyed by its thread's stable
 * `key`, so the text goes back into the same conversation it was aimed at or
 * it goes nowhere.
 *
 * THREE THINGS TRAVEL, not one. The text alone is not enough: putting a
 * sentence back with the caret at position 0 is still taking the caret out of
 * it, and putting it back without focus means the next keystroke goes to the
 * document. Value, selection and focus move together or the fix is cosmetic.
 *
 * A field that no longer exists — its thread resolved while the reply was
 * being written — is dropped rather than resurrected. Nothing here creates a
 * card; a draft is carried across a rebuild, never held against one.
 *
 * @param saved what was in the fields before the rebuild
 * @param fields the fields that exist now
 * @returns what to write back, in `fields` order

// --- where a thread belongs ---

/**
 * threadPlacement answers the one question the rail was asking wrong: does
 * this thread have a PLACE in the document, and if so how is it found?
 *
 * `!!thread.run` used to stand in for that, and it was right for exactly as
 * long as every thread hung on a mark. A block thread and a figure-region
 * thread have no mark BY CONSTRUCTION — that is the whole reason docmodel.Note
 * exists — so both fell through to the anchorless region at the rail's foot,
 * far from the figure they are about, and both were still drawn with a
 * connector arm reaching left to a position that means nothing. One wrong
 * predicate, two symptoms.
 *
 * A block thread is not anchorless. It names a block key, `/_galley/pending`
 * reports every addressable block with the INDEX of that key among the
 * document's top-level children, and the browser can measure that child. So
 * the answer is three-valued, not two:
 *
 *   mark        a range thread on a highlight — measured through its run
 *   block       a block or figure thread — measured through its block's element
 *   anchorless  genuinely nowhere: a range thread whose highlight is gone or
 *               ambiguous, or a block key this pending refresh does not know
 *
 * Only the first two get a connector, and that is the rule rather than a
 * detail: the line exists to say "this card is about THAT", and a card with no
 * place has no THAT to point at. Drawing one anyway is the visible half of the
 * same mistake.
 *
 * THE THIRD VERDICT NAMES A CONDITION AND NOT A PLACE, AND THAT IS WHY IT
 * SURVIVED THE PLACE BEING DELETED TWICE. It was first called `foot`, for the
 * foot of a fixed viewport-height column; when the rail became document-tall it
 * was renamed for the CONDITION, and rendered in a section in flow after the
 * map. The rail holds live work only now — *here is what needs you, beside the
 * text it is about* — and a card that is beside nothing is not that, so the
 * old loose section was deleted, then the count stopped opening the sheet and
 * the full card returned in `.gly-rail-unplaced`. The verdict is unchanged,
 * because it was never about where the card went: it tells each surface that
 * this card must stay in flow and must not offer a jump to missing prose.
 *
 * The index comes from the server's block list and is used IMMEDIATELY, never
 * stored: it renumbers the instant anything is inserted above it, which is why
 * the key exists. Same rule as an ordinal suggestion id.
 *
 * @param blocks the pending payload's blocks
