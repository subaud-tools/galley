// web/pending.ts owns the poll-and-refresh loop that keeps the reviewer's
// screen matching the server's `/_galley` state: `tick` watches for a saved
// projection and a moved revision, `refreshPending` re-reads the pending view
// and repaints census/revise/hold/rail from it, `noticeArrivals` decides
// whether a fresh arrival gets a strip or an on-screen ring, and
// `refreshVersions` keeps History's own count in step. It is a MIXIN — an
// object of methods `Object.assign`ed onto `App.prototype` in entry.ts — not
// a class of its own, so every method here still reads and writes `this` on
// the live App instance exactly as it did before the move (`this.rev`,
// `this.suggestions`, `this.comments`, `this.rail`, `this.strip`,
// `this.versionsPanel`, and so on).
//
// `this` IS TYPED AGAINST `AppShell` (web/appshell.ts) — see that file's own
// header for the this-typing decision this and every other mixin now shares.
