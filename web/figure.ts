// NodeView is the right mechanism for exactly that reason: the document is
// untouched and only the DOM is ours.
//
// If either one ever needs to WRITE, it is the wrong mechanism and the change
// belongs on the Go side where the round trip is tested. internal/serve's
// TestMermaidFenceRoundTripsByteIdentically is the gate that says so: it opens
// a document with a diagram in it and asserts the bytes written back are the
// bytes read. A rendered fence is a picture OF the fence.
//
// The chip and the caret note are the two halves of one refusal voice (§6, R8),
// and a figure gets both for the same reason a table does: a rule that only
// appears after you break it is a rule the reviewer meets as a bug.
