// entry.ts — the front door to web/: builds the editor, owns the App shell,
// and assembles the ten mixins everything else in this directory hangs off.
//
// The shell (internal/serve/edit.html) supplies #editor with data-room and
// data-doc and calls window.galleyEdit.init({room, wsURL}). `init()` below
// does the one-time construction: the Yjs document, the websocket provider,
// and TipTap bound to the SAME fragment the Go side writes — suggestion mode,
// litigation mode, and trail mode are extensions wired in here, alongside
// StarterKit and the node views (NoteBlock, FrontMatterBlock, MathBlock,
// TableRow/Cell/Header, the image and mermaid node views).
//
// `class App` is what init() constructs one of. It holds the state every
// surface in this directory reads — the editor, the ydoc, the provider, the
// latest poll response, which surfaces are on screen. Its own method list,
// 31 methods including the constructor, is not a handful and is not
// leftover scraps: the arrival strip (makeStrip/showStrip/hideStrip/showMe),
// the instruction rail itself (makeRail/paintRail), the trail
// (trailEntries/clearTrail), note-words painting (paintNoteWords), keeping
// the reviewer's place across a whole-document rebuild
// (keepPlace/rememberPlace/restorePlace/findSpan/spanIsShown/sectionFor),
// draft-carrying across that same rebuild
// (draftRoots/draftFields/captureDrafts/restoreDrafts), lit-run highlighting
// (watchLit/litRuns/litRunAt/paintLit/runsNow/reveal), and the bar/census
// wiring that watches the DOM for it (watchBar/chromeFrame/pulseCensus/
// clearNewLater/readChanges) all stayed here because they are the shell's
// own state, not because nobody got to them yet.
//
// Its READ surface is bigger than even that: immediately after the class
// declaration, eleven `Object.assign(App.prototype, …Methods)` calls mix in
// the modules this file used to be — `keys.ts`, `pending.ts`, `sheet.ts`,
// `cards.ts`, `composer.ts`, `figures.ts`, `history.ts`, `bar.ts`,
// `verdict.ts`, `seal.ts`, `share.ts` — each commented at its own assignment with what
// it owns. Read those comments, not this one, for what any given surface
// does; this file is the shell they all attach to, not a description of
// them.
//
// This file also imports several modules it does not own the state of:
// `rail.ts`, `card.ts`, `runs.ts`, `trail.ts`, `suggestions.ts`, `note.ts`,
// `figure.ts` and others are the arithmetic and DOM-building the mixins and
// this file call into, most of them pure (no `this`, checkable under
// `probe.mjs` with no browser at all); `versions.ts` exports its own
// `VersionsPanel` class with its own state, constructed once here and held
// on `this.versionsPanel` for the mixins to read. Their own headers say what
// each is for and, for the pure ones, why they are not mixins themselves.
//
// The contracts this file must not drift from:
//
//   fragment    "content" (ydoc.FragmentName). y-prosemirror's default is
//               "prosemirror"; a client that forgets to configure this edits a
//               different, empty fragment and reports no error at all.
//   marks       ins / del / highlight, attributes {author, at} as plain
//               objects — the shape internal/ydoc writes (see encodeMarkAttrs).
//   heading     level arrives as the STRING "2", not the number 2, because the
//               Go bridge writes XML attributes and those are strings. See
//               TolerantHeading.
//   undo        Yjs owns it. StarterKit's history extension is off; the
//               Collaboration extension brings y-prosemirror's yUndoPlugin and
//               binds Mod-z / Mod-y / Shift-Mod-z to it.
//   decisions   accept/reject are POSTs. The server transforms the document
//               and the result arrives over the websocket.
//
// TYPING `class App`, AND WHAT THIS TASK FOUND WRONG IN THE THREE TASKS THAT
// PRECEDED IT. `web/appshell.ts` carries the whole `this`-typing decision;
// read it first. Its conclusion applies here as designed: `class App
// implements AppState` is real verification (every field below is one the
// constructor assigns, checked against the interface's 78 assertions), and
// `interface App extends AppMethods {}` immediately after the ten
// `Object.assign` calls is a declaration of the other 82, not a check —
// necessarily so, since nothing in the class body defines them.
//
// THE MECHANISM WORKED EXACTLY AS DESIGNED. `class App implements AppState`
// compiles and genuinely checks every field; `interface App extends
// AppMethods {}` compiles and (as appshell.ts's header already says) proves
// nothing about the 82 beyond their names existing somewhere.
//
// TWO OF THE 78 ASSERTIONS WERE ALREADY WRONG BEFORE THIS TASK STARTED —
// `blurDismiss` and the six revise-label fields — both retyped `| undefined`
// by earlier tasks and left that way here; see appshell.ts for the
// constructor lines. TASK 8 FOUND NO FURTHER AppState FIELD WRONG: every
// other field really is assigned unconditionally in this constructor, in
// the order AppState lists them. What Task 8 DID find wrong were two things
// one level up from AppState's own fields:
//
//   - `scheduleAnchors` was declared as a METHOD in AppMethods, on the
//     assumption that everything reaching App via Object.assign belongs
//     there. It does not: `this.scheduleAnchors = coalesce(...)` a few
//     hundred lines down is a direct, unconditional FIELD assignment in
//     THIS constructor, the same shape as `cardSizes` beside it. Moved to
//     AppState; see appshell.ts's note at that field for the full argument.
//   - AppMethods was missing every constructor-only builder this file calls
//     by name (`makeCensus`, `makeSheet`, `makeRevise`, `onKey`, `refuse`,
//     `enterHistory`, and sixteen more) — real mixin methods from Tasks 5-7,
//     each already carrying `this: AppShell`, that nothing before this task
//     needed typed because nothing before this task's own constructor CALLED
//     them through a typed `this`. They are added to AppMethods now, for the
//     same reason every earlier member was: a member silently missing from
//     the shared surface that a real caller still needs is exactly the wrong
//     assumption AppShell exists to make loud. See appshell.ts's own
//     addition for the full list.
//
// `barSize` is the one field genuinely conditional at construction —
// `this.barSize = new ResizeObserver(...)` runs only inside watchBar()'s
// `typeof window.ResizeObserver === 'function'` branch — and is typed
// `ResizeObserver | undefined` for exactly that reason; it is not in
// AppState because no mixin reads it, only watchBar's own unpublish path
// would (there is none).

// --- a code fence cannot be CREATED here either ---
//
// A fence is read-only (see suggestions.ts), and phase 1 has nowhere to record
// an edit to one. Creating one is the same problem wearing a friendlier face:
// ``` + space made an untracked, empty codeBlock — nothing in
// /_galley/pending, nothing to accept — and then trapped the reviewer inside
// it. Typing refused, Backspace refused (a join), Mod-Alt-c refused
// (un-fencing): Ctrl-Z was the only way out, and anyone who did not undo left
// an empty fence in the author's file with no record that it happened. The
// refusal's advice ("edit fenced code in your own editor") was wrong for a
// fence made two seconds ago in THIS editor.
//
// The fix is not to allow editing the fences you made — that means tracking
// provenance, and reopens the "nowhere to record it" problem that made the
// original three bugs one bug. It is to make the policy on screen true exactly
// as written: you cannot make a fence here, and you cannot change one.
// Recording fence content properly is phase 3's per-line mechanism, not a
// fourth special case.
//
// So the node stays in the schema, exactly as it is — documents are FULL of
// fences and every one of them must still parse, render, select and copy — and
// only the three ways this editor could CREATE one are removed:
//
//   input rules            ``` and ~~~ turning a paragraph into a fence
//   Mod-Alt-c              toggleCodeBlock, which also un-fences
//   the VS Code paste      the extension's own plugin, which turns a paste
//   handler                carrying `vscode-editor-data` into a new fence
//
// Everything else the extension does is kept — including its Backspace, Enter
// and ArrowDown handlers, which act INSIDE a fence and are refused by the

// The same cut as the code fence, for the same reason, in the same voice.
// Tables are read-only in phase 1: they render, prose around them is fully
// markable, and cells are not editable and carry no suggestion marks.
//
// Why the cut is here and not one notch further. A cell is prose, so
// half-supporting it is tempting in a way a fence never was — and
// half-supporting is precisely how the fence bug happened. Creating a fence
// was allowed where editing one was not, so ``` + space made an untracked
// empty block with nothing in /_galley/pending, and then trapped the reviewer
// inside it. A table has more ways to go wrong, not fewer: suggest.List reads
// Block.Inlines and a cell's inlines are a level below anything the
// suggestion pipeline reaches, and the column count and the delimiter row are
// STRUCTURE, which phase 1 does not track at all (the README says so, and the
// editor's panel says so). Cell-level tracked changes are phase 3, alongside
// per-line code suggestions.
//
// So the nodes stay in the schema — documents are full of tables and every
// one must parse, render, select and copy — and every way this editor could
// change or create one is removed:
//
//   tableEditing plugin   cell selection, the Tab/Backspace cell handling and
//                         the goToNextCell keymap
//   columnResizing        drags a column border and writes colwidth onto
//                         every cell in it: a real mutation of the author's
//                         document, with no keystroke and no record of it

// belt-and-braces the fence has.
// --- the passive half of the refusal voice, as an element ---

// custom(...)`, and the plain-`NodeViewDesc` branch runs only when `spec`
// is falsy) and against THIS REPOSITORY'S OWN TEST: probe.mjs's "a
// non-mermaid fence gets no NodeView at all" calls
// `FiguredCodeBlock.config.addNodeView` directly and asserts the result is

  // own height is exactly that number — and it is not a constant: the status
  // line wraps on a narrow window, the census strip drops its sentence at
  // 1200px, and a reviewer's font size is not this stylesheet's business. So
  // it is MEASURED and published as `--gly-bar-h`, the same way a card's
  // height is measured rather than assumed (see cardSizes).
  //
  // This observer cannot feed itself. It writes a custom property that only
  // the panel reads, and the panel is out of flow — its height can never
  // change the bar's, which is the loop that would otherwise be waiting here.
  // chromeFrame is the band of the window the PROSE is readable in, in viewport
  // coordinates — which is not the window. The top bar is sticky at 0 and the

  // clamps to the window is drawn over one of them. Measured with a
  // conversation covering `✓ all`, the since-retired `✗ all` and the whole-doc
  // handle in a short window; the bubble asks this instead (see
  // SuggestionUI.topFor).
  //
  // MEASURED, not read off --gly-bar-h. That property is this side's PUBLICATION
  // of the same number for the stylesheet's use, and reading it back would make
  // a consumer of a value that only exists to be written. The bottom bar is

  // be half-written when that happens: the RAIL (its root, so the band is
  // walked), the overall card, whose entries are thread cards with reply boxes
  // of their own, and the SHEET, which was the fourth and was missing.
  //
  // It is a LIST, so it goes stale the moment the one card component renders on
  // a surface nobody added here — measured, a thirty-five character reply typed
  // into a sheet thread card came back `''` with focus on `BODY`, while the
  // same gesture in the rail survived in the same run.
  //
  // TWO POPULATIONS CHANGED SURFACE AND THE LIST DID NOT HAVE TO, WHICH IS THE
  // CASE IT HAS GONE STALE ON BEFORE. Settled conversations and anchorless ones
  // used to render inside `this.rail.root` (the settled list and the anchorless
  // section) and they render in the SHEET now — every one of them a thread card
  // with a `.gly-thread-reply` box and a `data-draft` key. Both the surface they
  // left and the surface they arrived at are already here, so no reply box has
  // become unwalkable. That is worth stating rather than trusting, because this
  // list's whole failure mode is a card moving to a root nobody added: had the
  // settled cards moved to a fifth surface instead, this comment would be the
  // change that was missed.
  //
  // THE SHEET GOES FIRST, AND ONLY WHILE IT IS OPEN, because it is the surface
  // in this list that COLLIDES with the others. It renders `railThreads ∪
  // overallThreads` plus the settled region, so its reply boxes carry exactly
  // the `data-draft` keys the rail's and the panel's do — and both
  // `carryDrafts` and `restoreDrafts` take the FIRST field under a key. First
  // therefore has to mean "the one the reviewer can actually type into", which
  // the sheet is whenever it is up: it is `inset: 0` at `z-index: 45`, and
  // `railSurfaces` now hides the rail outright at EVERY width the sheet is open
  // at rather than only below the breakpoint. Closed, it keeps its last render
  // in the DOM, so listing it unconditionally would let a stale hidden field

 * it — so a reviewer who swept out a phrase, looked up at an arrival and came
 * back was operating on nothing, with the caret at the end of the document.
 * Measured: a 20-character sweep at 194→214 of a 1349-position document ended
 * collapsed at 1351. So both ends get the same two coordinates the caret gets,
 * plus the text between them (see spanIn) and the DIRECTION — a sweep
 * right-to-left has its head at the range's start, and that is where the next
