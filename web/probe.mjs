// probe.mjs — the build-time sanity check for the editor bundle.
//
// There is no JS test harness in this repo and no intention of adding one:
// the editor's real verification is Task 12's Playwright pass in a browser.
// But two things can be checked without one, and both have already been the
// kind of mistake that costs an afternoon in a browser:
//
//   1. the suggestion plugin's behaviour. ProseMirror's state, model and
//      transform packages need no DOM, so the plugin can be driven directly:
//      type, delete, delete your own insertion, type over a selection.
//   2. the heading level arriving as a STRING. Task 6 leaves it that way, and
//      an untreated string level renders every heading as h1.
//
// Plus the built bundle parses. `just assets` runs this; a failure here means
// the committed bundle is wrong, which nothing downstream would notice until
// someone opened the page.

// COURT'S THIRD FINDING, AND THE FOURTH SHAPE OF ONE BUG. §6 gave a
// block-emptying deletion a rung of its own; §8 made that rung ask for
// evidence; §9 made the evidence three-valued. Each of those asks about ONE
// entry, and n of them against m empty blocks is not n copies of that question
// — it is an ASSIGNMENT, and document order is a fact about the set that no
// per-entry rung can see. Three configurations were measured on the build
// before this section, driving the passes below:
//
//   two paragraphs struck between three IDENTICAL lines — both entries carry
//     the same evidence, both refused for ambiguity, and both ghosts were lost
//     on the first server-side mutation. `0/2 anchored`.
//   FOUR adjacent paragraphs struck — the two INTERIOR entries both record an
//     empty block above and an empty block below, so both refused while the
//     outer two anchored. `2/4 anchored`.
//   two struck between identical lines, then the LOWER gap closed — the lower
//     entry's block was joined away, its stale evidence still matched the
//     upper entry's block, and its ghost was drawn THERE. Two ghosts on one
//     block: the reviewer reads two deletions on a line that lost one, which
//     is the wrong-anchor failure §8 exists to forbid, reached from a
//     direction §8 could not see.
//
// AND TWO ADJACENT PARAGRAPHS ALREADY WORKED, which is why the fixtures below
// carry the repeated line. §9's three-valued evidence discriminates a pair —
// the upper records "an empty block below", the lower "an empty block above" —
// so a fixture of two adjacent strikes in ordinary prose passes with the set
// rule REMOVED, and a section built only from one would certify nothing. It is
// pinned anyway, because it must keep working.

//
// The set search is exhaustive, so it is bounded twice — by how many entries it
// will search over (TRAIL_SET_CAP) and by how much searching it will do
// (TRAIL_SET_NODES) — and past either it hands back to the weak rule: an entry
// is placed only where it has ONE compatible candidate and no other entry could
// want that one. Every part of that was untested, and the bound itself was
// advertised at roughly double what it was: the docstring said sixteen entries
// while a budget of 20000 nodes stopped the search at NINE adjacent strikes and
// EIGHT strikes in a stanza of identical lines, so the seventeen-entry branch
// could not be reached and a reviewer striking a ten-line list got the weak
// answer while being told the bound was sixteen.
//
// SO THE BOUND WAS MEASURED, in a real chromium (141.0.7390.37, this machine),
// timing settleEntries over the document a server-side mutation leaves — the
// settle that actually has to re-anchor them all. Median of the run, and the
// node counts are the search's own counter:
//
//   entries   adjacent strikes        strikes in an identical stanza
//         8      7,260 nodes  0.2ms       24,821 nodes   0.5ms
//        10    100,616 nodes  1.6ms      354,763 nodes   8.1ms
//        11    380,264 nodes  6.1ms    1,356,173 nodes  33.2ms
//        12  1,446,508 nodes 24.9ms    5,208,491 nodes 132.5ms
//        16    315.6M nodes    6.1s        1.167G nodes  35.6s
//
// TEN is therefore the boundary and the cap is set there: the worst shape an
// ordinary hand produces at ten costs 8.1ms, eleven costs four times that, and
// sixteen — the number that used to be advertised — is thirty-five SECONDS on
// the settle path. The node budget is no longer the thing that bites for these
// shapes (600000 admits 354,763 with room), which is what makes the cap the
// stated bound and the budget what it always should have been: the backstop for
// a shape nobody measured, since cost depends on the CANDIDATES too and a

// no data, which is exactly what this file calls a check that certifies
// nothing.
//
// WHAT THE BUTTON SAYS NOW IS STILL CHECKED, one file over and one surface up:

// mark within the viewport" two frames in, and was wrong in BOTH directions —
// each of the two reproduced failures is a check below:
//
//   a mark parked a few pixels inside the bottom edge satisfied bare
