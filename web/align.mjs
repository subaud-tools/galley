// align.mjs — THE CONTENT PANE ALIGNS TO THE LIVE PAGE, AND CLEARS OUTSIDE
// BOTH VIEW.
//
// In page mode's Both view the two panes show the same document twice: the
// real page on the left, the editable prose on the right. They cannot agree
// line for line — a hero is tall on the page and one line in the editor — so
// the panes are aligned at the SECTION level: each content heading is nudged
// DOWN, by a measured amount, to sit level with the same heading in the page.
// The nudge is a ProseMirror node decoration writing `padding-top` (web/
// headingalign.ts), fed a measured map by alignHeadings() in web/preview.ts.
//
// NO OTHER GATE CAN SEE THIS. page.mjs proves the page survives the loop and
// never opens Both view's geometry; probe.mjs has no browser; the Go side has
// never heard of a heading's padding. Every claim here is a MEASUREMENT taken
// in a real chromium against a real page, which is the only place the feature
// exists. Its four claims:
//
//   ALIGNMENT IS APPLIED — after the page settles, at least one content
//   heading carries a padding-top the editor never wrote itself.
//
//   THE CAP IS RESPECTED — no heading is bumped past MAX_ALIGN_BUMP_PX (260).
//   That cap is the whole trade: where a page region renders far taller, the
//   honest gap is a full screen, and a gate that only checked "aligned" would
//   be green on a blank screen of spacer.
//
//   IT ACTUALLY ALIGNS A SECTION — the first bumped heading's TEXT top lands
//   within a tolerance of its page counterpart's top, measured through the
//   iframe's own offset. This is the claim the padding is FOR; the two above
//   are satisfied by any padding at all.
//
//   IT CLEARS OUTSIDE BOTH, AND COMES BACK — Content view leaves every heading
//   at padding 0 (a spacer with nothing to align to is a hole in the prose),
//   and returning to Both re-measures rather than restoring a stale map.
//
// Plus the direction: the feature only ever pushes DOWN. A heading the page
// renders ABOVE the editor's own position gets nothing, because pulling up
// would need negative space the editor has no room for.
//
// PIXELS, BUT NOT EXACT PIXELS. Every number here is a threshold with slack —
// fonts, images and the iframe's own growth move the page by a few px between
// runs — and a heading whose counterpart cannot be found is SKIPPED rather
// than failed, because the match key is text and a fixture is allowed to have
// prose the page renders in a form the editor does not.
//
// Running it:
//
//   just build
//   GALLEY="$PWD/bin/galley" node web/align.mjs
//
// It needs a chromium for playwright to drive: `npx playwright install
// chromium` once, or GALLEY_CHROME=<executable>. There is a `just align`
// recipe, it is in `just gates`, and it is a step of its own in ci.yml.
