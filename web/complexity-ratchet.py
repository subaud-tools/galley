"""Fail when web/ gains a genuinely complex function.

Reads `fallow health --format json` on stdin and counts only the findings that
exceed a COGNITIVE or CYCLOMATIC threshold. Findings that exceed CRAP alone are
ignored, and that is the whole point of this script existing rather than a grep
on fallow's own summary line.

CRAP is `CC^2 * (1-coverage)^3 + CC`. There is no TypeScript coverage
instrumentation in this repo, so fallow computes it at 0% coverage, where it
collapses to `CC^2 + CC` — and at CC 5 that is exactly the 30-point threshold.
So a CRAP-only finding means "this function has five or more branches", which
describes most functions ever written. 161 of fallow's 177 are that.

It also inverted the incentive: extracting a helper out of a complex function
creates a new small function, which at CC>=5 is a new CRAP finding, so a real
improvement moved the total UP. Measured: 177 -> 178 on an extraction that took
paintChanges from CC19/Cog25 to CC13/Cog18.

If coverage instrumentation ever lands, CRAP becomes meaningful and this should
be revisited.

web/kit/ is not counted: it is tools-common's code, copied from the module
go.mod pins by `just assets`, and no galley branch can simplify it (the kit's
h() builder is over both thresholds).
