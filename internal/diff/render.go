//
// IT WRAPS ITS BLOCKS LIKE THE OTHER THREE. The first cut emitted every column
// as a run of paragraphs, so a heading read as `# The rail is a map` and a
// three-row table as one line of pipes — the same defect the flow renderer had,
// in the one view whose whole claim is that each version reads AS ITSELF.
//
// AND IT STAMPS ITS REGIONS LIKE THE OTHER TWO THAT CARRY MARKUP, which is the
// same lesson a third time. The reading rail places each change card beside its
// mark by looking `[data-gly-region="k"]` up in the rendered diff; this view
// stamped nothing, so choosing `side by side` failed every lookup at once and
// every card fell back to stacking from the top of the rail. CLAUDE.md: A CLICK
// MOVES NOTHING EXCEPT THE THING THAT WAS CLICKED — the reader clicked a
// reading, and the rail beside it is not the thing they clicked. A view that
// paints a change and does not name it is a view the rail cannot be drawn
// against, so the stamp belongs to the renderer and not to whoever remembers.
//
// THE ORDINALS ARE RegionOps' AND NOT THIS FUNCTION'S. It walks the same ops
// slice renderFlow walks and asks regionIndex — the shared lookup — for every
// k, rather than counting changed ops as it goes. Counting again would produce
// the same numbers on every document anyone tried and different ones the day a
// filter moved (a move is one region at its DELETION, an absorbed op is no
// region at all), and the disagreement would be silent: a card would point at
// one change in `changes` and at a different one in `side by side`, with each
// view internally consistent and nothing to catch it. CLAUDE.md's own words for
// it: one list, three readers.
//
// THE AFTER COLUMN CARRIES THE ID WHEREVER THERE IS AN AFTER. A card is the
// agent's testimony about what it WROTE, so the sentence the card describes is
// the one on the right, and that is where the reader should be taken and what
// should light beside its card. It is also the only choice that keeps the id
// UNIQUE: the browser resolves a region with querySelector, which answers with
// the first match in document order, and the before column is emitted first —
// so stamping both sides would silently hand every card the old reading of its
// own change. That is why a MOVE is stamped at its arrival here and at both
// ends in the flow views: two columns are one lookup, and the end the agent put
// there is the after end.
//
// A LOOKUP THAT CAN MATCH TWO ELEMENTS IS NOT A LOOKUP, and the browser side of
// this contract is ALREADY weaker than it reads — which is said out loud here
// because this is where the decision gets made for the first time. renderFlow
// stamps both ends of a move with the one ordinal a move earns (deliberate, and
// asserted in diff_test.go), so a region id is not unique in that markup
// either; versions.js then reads it two ways — align() and pick() take
// querySelector's FIRST match while paintPick() takes querySelectorAll's every
// match, so a moved sentence already lights at both ends and scrolls to one.
// That is a browser-side question and this package is not the place to answer
// it. What this package can refuse to do is make the rare case the common one:
// side by side renders every changed sentence TWICE, so stamping both columns
// would put a duplicate id on every ordinary change and not merely on a move.
// The next reader who wants the second column stamped for symmetry is the
// reason this paragraph exists — symmetry is not the property, findability is,
