// Package review defines the shape of a review's unsent comments as a Yjs
// document.
//
// The document is the live state: the browser edits it over the y-websocket
// protocol, the server edits it in-process, and neither has to poll the other.
// Its durable mirror is the unsent round, internal/unsent's pending.json,
// which the edit server writes after every change and replays at startup.
//
// Schema, rooted at the "threads" map:
//
//	threads: YMap                      key = the comment's ID (unsent.NewID)
//	  <id>: YMap
//	    heading:  string               the quoted words the comment is on
//	    entries:  YArray               chronological
//	      [n]: YMap
//	        author: "user" | "agent"
//	        at:     RFC3339 string
//	        text:   YText              character-level, so concurrent edits merge
//
// The reviewer's words are a YText, so an edit is the smallest delete and
// insert (SetComment) and a concurrent edit from another peer merges.
//
// A key this schema does not name is ignored on read: a `resolved` written by
// an older galley is one.
