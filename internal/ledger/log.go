// Package ledger is galley's memory: what was decided, by whom, and why.
//
// It is two stores and ONE DIRECTION between them, and the direction is the
// whole design (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-the-ledger.md):
//
//   - THE LOG — `<repo>/.galley/decisions.jsonl`, committed, append-only, one
//     JSON object per decision. Authoritative. Readable with no tooling, and
//     it travels with the branch, so a teammate who clones the repo gets the
//     decision history without needing anything from the machine it was made
//     on. This file.
//   - THE INDEX — a per-user SQLite store, DERIVED, never written to
//     independently. index.go.
//
// A failed ingest therefore leaves the log correct and the next ingest catches
// up: drift is self-healing rather than a class of bug.
//
// THE LEDGER IS MEMORY, NEVER TRUTH, and that is not a slogan — it is the
// contract every function here is written to. Review state stays where it
// lives: the .md, its versions and its unsent round. No review path may ever REQUIRE this package. So every failure here
// is a returned error the caller is free to drop on the floor — never a panic,
// never a block, never a partially-applied review. `Append` on a read-only
// filesystem loses a memory; it must not lose a decision. See
// TestAppendFailsSoft, which is the assertion behind that sentence.
