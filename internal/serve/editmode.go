// ygo document, which exists only while a session runs.

// The mutex is what makes the read-transform-write sequence atomic WITH
// RESPECT TO OTHER SERVER-SIDE WRITERS — the instruction and revert
// endpoints, the send, the agent's import, Project, and Flush. Nothing in ygo offers that atomicity to piggyback on, so
// there is nothing cheaper to use instead.
//
// In particular it cannot be Apply-scoped, and the reason is worth stating
// precisely because the phase-1 plan proposed exactly that ("read via ydoc.Read
// inside the Apply callback, before transact"). Apply holds NO document lock
// across its callback — established by reading ygo v1.43.0's
// provider/websocket/inject.go: Apply subscribes an OnUpdate capture, hands fn
// a transact helper that is a plain doc.Transact with Apply's own origin, and
// merges whatever that helper captured into one broadcast. The lock is taken
// and released inside each individual transact call, nowhere else. (Reading
// inside the callback is therefore fine, and this file already does it —
// NewEdit and applyModel both call doc.GetMap there.)
//
// What Apply gives is broadcast atomicity, NOT state atomicity: several
// transact calls in one callback reach peers as a single update, but the
// document is unlocked between them, and unlocked between the callback
// starting and its first transact. So a read placed inside the callback is no
// more serialized against a concurrent writer than a read placed outside it —
// it would buy nothing, which is why the mutex, and not callback placement, is
// what makes this correct.
//
// KNOWN, ACCEPTED LIMITATION — last writer wins against the BROWSER. The
// mutex does not (and cannot) hold back a peer's edit arriving over the
// websocket, and the write-back is ydoc.Load, a full fragment rebuild. So a
// keystroke landing in the window between the read and the Apply is clobbered:
// the rebuilt fragment reflects the snapshot plus this mutation, not the
// keystroke. The window is milliseconds, and capture mode means the reviewer
// is asking the agent to work and then reading the result rather than typing
// through it — but it is a real hole, not a theoretical one. Phase 3's

// the discussion and the hours of context blocks on the document and is woken
// when the reviewer asks. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-the-agent-hook.md.
//
// Nothing here decides whether the document has moved. Both release paths ride
// a decision that already exists: the notifier's fire (which carries mutate's
// self-wake seed) for a settle, and handleRevise's press for a revise. A
// second implementation of "has anything changed" would work, pass, and drift
// the first time either side was touched.

// The eight things a poll can report. revise, settle, approve, discard,
// reopen and changed are wakes; the other two are how the caller learns to
// re-arm or to stop. Each terminal ending carries its own reason so a waiter
// (and the CLI's exit path) can tell it apart from an ordinary ask for another
// pass — and reopen is the one wake that says the review is LIVE again, which
// is why a channel returns on approve and discard but keeps polling through
// this one.
//
// `changed` IS THE HONEST ONE, AND IT IS THE CATCH-UP'S. Every other reason
// names an EVENT the server watched happen; the catch-up watched nothing — it
// found the caller's cursor behind and the document moved, which says THAT
// something happened and never WHAT. It answered `settle` unconditionally, and
// `settle` is a specific claim: the document settled and the live-mode
// notifier fired. On a session `on ask` — the default — nothing settles a
// waiter at all, so the word named an event that could not have occurred; and
// an approve or a discard missed in the same gap arrived under it too, sending
// an agent to answer a review that had ended. A terminal ending is replayed
