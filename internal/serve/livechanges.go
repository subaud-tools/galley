// WHAT THE REVIEWER HAS CHANGED BY HAND SINCE THE LAST ROUND, computed live.
//
// ONE SURFACE, ALL OF IT. The user: "the list on the right rail is the list of
// instructions going to be revised. we don't need a second list or surface…
// one surface. all of the instructions."
//
// The rail held instruction threads and nothing else, so it showed half of what
// a round carries: the reviewer's own edits are sent too — that is what the
// round's `changes` are for, and without them an agent rewrites the reviewer's
// deletions back — and there was no surface for them anywhere. The recorded
// design said so out loud ("the trail has no surface anywhere") and answered a
// missing half with a SECOND list, reachable from the Revise button. That is
// the two-things-doing-one-job shape this codebase fixes by deletion.
//
// SO THE RAIL BECOMES WHAT THIS ROUND CARRIES, which is the honest description
// of a column that already holds instructions written and not yet sent. Its old
// rule — *here is what needs you, beside the text it is about* — survives the
// change better than it reads: an edit is beside its text more reliably than an
// unplaced instruction is.
//
// IT IS NOT `ReviewerChanges`, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE MOMENT. That one
// diffs the last committed ROUND against its predecessor: it describes a round
// already cut, and is what the agent is handed. This diffs the last committed
// version against the LIVE document: it describes a round not yet sent, which
// is the only thing a reviewer can still act on. The two agree at the instant
// of a send, and answer different questions either side of it.
//
// NOTHING WHILE A HANDOFF IS OPEN, and that is not caution. During the window
// the file belongs to the agent, its saves stream into the live document, and
// the browser is read-only — so a diff against the last version would report
// THE AGENT'S in-progress work as the reviewer's own hand. That is the same
// attribution inversion `ReviewerChanges` filters `ReasonRevise` to avoid,
// arriving through the other door.
//
// AND IT READS THE REVIEWER'S WHOLE SPAN (reviewerSpan), with the live
// document as its last segment, so edits held when a change outside the editor
// was loaded stay on the rail beside the ones typed since.
