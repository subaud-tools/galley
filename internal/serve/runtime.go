// The one-editor-per-document advert: <doc>.serve.json beside the document,
// written by `galley edit` (cli.announceEdit) and read by every CLI verb that
// looks for a running server.

// roomIdleTimeout is applied to every ws.Server this package constructs
// (EditServer.NewEdit). A galley process serves exactly one
// room for its whole lifetime, and pins doc = yjs.GetDoc(room) once, in the
// constructor, before any peer can ever reconnect. ws.NewServer's default
// RoomIdleTimeout is 0 — eager-evict: the room is destroyed the instant its
// last websocket peer disconnects (a page reload, a tab close, a transient
// network drop). The NEXT connection then creates a brand-new room with a
// brand-new *crdt.Doc, and every later browser edit lands there — invisible
// to the doc this process pinned, and so invisible to Project, /_galley/pending,
// and pending.json, which all read the pinned doc. Silent data loss.
//
// ws.Server's config surface has no "never evict" sentinel (RoomIdleTimeout
// must be > 0 to switch out of eager-evict at all — see ygo's idle_sweep.go),
// so this is set to a duration long enough that it cannot fire within the
// life of any real `galley edit` process: the server itself is
// the room's only owner, and there is nothing else to reclaim the room from.

// and each project their own back over it, and neither can see the other: A's
// edit lands on disk, B's next projection writes B's pre-edit
// document over it, and A's shutdown flush writes A's over that. Measured, one
// agent's whole session was erased with nothing logged, nothing warned, and
// both processes exiting 0 — see TestTwoEditorsOnOneDocumentEraseEachOther,
// which keeps that failure executable.
//
// A dead PID's advert is NOT a claim: crashes, SIGKILLs and closed laptops all

// A DEAD SERVER IS NEVER RETURNED. FindRuntime used to hand a caller the last
