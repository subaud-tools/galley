// DELETE THE SENTENCE, DELETE THE INSTRUCTION ABOUT IT.
//
// The user: "if we highlight a sentence and add an instruction and then delete the
// sentence, we should delete the instruction as well."
//
// It is the idiom this codebase used one population over: deleting text under
// an AGENT's pending mark was the verdict by hand, and the proposal vanished.
// An instruction is the reviewer's own mark over their own words, and removing
// those words retracts it.
//
// A TEXT COMMENT'S PLACE IS ITS ID ON A HIGHLIGHT, and nothing else. Editing a
// word inside the highlight keeps the ID, so the comment stays; deleting every
// highlighted word deletes every mark carrying the ID, and that is the one
// event that retracts the comment.
//
// TWO GUARDS, and they guard different things:
//
//   - ONLY A TEXT COMMENT. `Anchor` is what says so: a block or whole-document
//     comment has no highlight by construction, so it has no mark to lose, and
//     retracting one would hide every whole-document instruction at the first
//     projection. A block comment whose note disappears stays, unplaced.
//   - ONLY A PLACE THIS SERVER HAS SEEN. "There is no mark now" is not "the
//     reviewer deleted it". A comment restored from pending.json whose mark the
//     .md no longer carries — an edit made while galley was stopped, a file
//     restored from git — also has no mark, and retracting on that evidence
//     would drop comments nobody touched, at startup, silently.
//     `seenAnchored` records the IDs that HAVE been placed, so the predicate is
//     the one actually wanted: the place was there, and now it is gone. It is
//     per process, and the cost is stated rather than hidden: a comment whose
//     place was already gone before this process started is never retracted. It
//     stays an unplaced card, which is the honest rendering.
//
// IT RUNS FROM `project`, which is where the server first learns the reviewer
// moved: a browser edit reaches the CRDT, `doc.OnUpdate` fires, `touch`
// schedules the debounced projection. There is no HTTP hook for typing, and the
// browser must NOT decide this — a thread is transiently unplaced on its first
// paint there, every time, because the projection reaches `/_galley/pending`
// before the websocket reaches the document, and a browser-side retraction
// would drop instructions as they arrived.
//
// IT WRITES NOTHING TO THE CRDT. The review map lives in the same Yjs document
// as the text, so a write to it reaches every peer as an update, like a
// keystroke. The comment
// leaves every surface because it leaves THE PENDING VIEW. `liveInstructions`
// hides a seen text comment that has no mark in the model it is reading, and
// every reader goes through it: the rail, `galley wait`, the wait's
// fingerprint and round capture. The thread stays in the review map
// until the next send, whose clear deletes it with the threads it sent (see
// sendReviewerRound). pending.json is the review map MINUS the retracted keys,
// so a restart does not bring the comment back; `project` rewrites it, before
// the .md, whenever the retracted set changes.
//
// WHY NO WRITE, measured on the eager version (6d03cfb), which deleted the
// thread from inside `project`:
//
//   - IT CUT A ROUND NOBODY ASKED FOR, under the retired live mode, where a
//     settle was a send. TestAnAgentWriteThatRemovesACommentsWordsCutsNoRound
//     cut one round on 6d03cfb. The same window broke the fingerprint for any
//     reader between the write and the projection
//     (TestTheWaitPayloadAndTheRailAgree).
//   - AN UNDO LOST THE COMMENT. Deleting the words, letting a projection run,
//     and pressing undo brings back the words and the highlight with its ID,
//     and the thread was already gone: the mark named nothing.
//     TestUndoingTheDeletionBringsTheCommentBack. With no write, the next
//     projection finds the mark again and the comment is back, in the rail and
//     in pending.json.
//   - WHAT THE GATE DID NOT SHOW. 6d03cfb's report re-ran `web/rounds-ux.mjs`
//     with the write in place, 5 green of 6, and read that as the earlier
//     spurious rounds gone. rounds-ux drove the retraction checks (§5.4) with
//     no settle sending, so it could not have seen that round. The Go test
//     above is the measurement.
//
// The earlier history, for the record: an eager deletion here was built first
// and backed out once already, for spurious rounds in rounds-ux, and moving
// the write to a goroutine through `mutate` made them worse.

//     retracted in live is withdrawn: retracted from now on whatever marks the
//     document carries. Without this, an outside writer restoring a file saved
