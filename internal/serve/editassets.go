// editassets.go serves the files that live BESIDE the document, so an
// "![alt](pic.png)" in the markdown resolves to an actual image.
//
// THIS REVERSES A PREVIOUS RULING. Task 9 decided that edit mode's "/" serves
// the shell and nothing else — "a markdown document has no sibling assets a
// review page would, and serving the whole directory a user's document
// happens to live in is a surface nobody asked for". The first half turned
// out to be simply untrue: a spec with a screenshot or an exported diagram
// references a file next to it, and with nothing serving that file the image
// 404s in the editor no matter what the author writes. A document that cannot
// show its own figures is not a document editor.
//
// The second half of that ruling still stands, and is what shapes this. The
// directory is NOT handed to http.FileServer. Five constraints, each closing a different
// door:
//
//   - GET AND HEAD ONLY. There is nothing to write here, and a handler that
//     answered other methods would be a surface to probe.
//   - AN EXTENSION ALLOWLIST, not a denylist. A document's directory is
//     also, very often, a source tree: .env, id_rsa, a database dump and
//     every other file the author never thought about are sitting right
//     there. Only the seven image extensions an "![…](…)" can legitimately
//     point at are served, so adding a new kind of file to that directory can
//     never widen what this exposes.
//   - INSIDE THE DOCUMENT'S DIRECTORY, enforced by the KERNEL. Every read
//     goes through EditServer.root, an *os.Root opened once at construction
//     (see NewEdit). os.Root resolves each path component itself and refuses
//     to leave, which closes both traversal and symlink escape without any
//     string arithmetic — and, unlike the EvalSymlinks-then-compare it
//     replaces, it does so AT OPEN TIME, so there is no window between the
//     check and the read for the filesystem to change underneath it.
//   - THE FIGURE ITSELF IS NOT A SYMLINK. This is the door that was open.
//     Containment was proven on the resolved path while the extension was
//     checked on the URL, and nothing re-checked the extension after
//     resolution — so `ln -s .env innocent.png`, wholly inside the directory
//     and contained by every measure, served AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=hunter2
//     as image/png. A symlink is exactly a file whose NAME says one thing and
//     whose BYTES are something else, and a name-based allowlist has no
//     defence against one. Refusing it is simpler and stronger than
//     re-deriving the type from the target: a figure beside a document has no
//     reason to be a link, and a link into the same directory only ever
//     renames a file that is already reachable under its own name.
//   - NO DIRECTORY LISTING and no implicit index — a request for a directory
//     is a 404 like anything else, so this never enumerates what is there.
//
// Everything that fails any of those is a plain 404, with no detail, and that
// uniformity is deliberate: "that exists but you may not have it" is itself an
// answer about the filesystem, so a refusal and an absence are byte-identical.
//
// A GET is not a POST, so `guard` — which requires POST and a JSON body —
// cannot cover this route. But guard's reasoning is about reads too ("THE
// THREAT IS AN ORDINARY WEB PAGE"), and the browser's cookie goes with a request
// from any port on 127.0.0.1, and the tree below the document is served
// recursively. Without a header saying otherwise, any page
// in the user's browser could embed
//
//	<img src="http://127.0.0.1:8123/Pictures/2024/private.jpg" onload=… onerror=…>
//
// and read off which files exist and how big they are. It could never read the
// bytes — no CORS header, and canvas taint blocks pixel extraction — but an
// existence oracle over a user's home directory is not nothing.
// Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin makes the browser refuse the embed
// outright, and no legitimate same-origin load is affected.

// assetTypes is the allowlist: extension -> the Content-Type it is served as.
//
// SVG IS SERVED AS image/svg+xml, DELIBERATELY, and it is the one entry here
// that is a judgement rather than a lookup.
//
// An SVG is a document, not an opaque blob: it can carry <script>. Served as
// text/plain it would be inert — and would also not render, which defeats the
// entire point of serving it, since a browser only paints an SVG in an <img>
// when it arrives as image/svg+xml. Exported diagrams (the mermaid and
// draw.io case this whole change is about) are overwhelmingly SVG, so
// "safe and useless" is not a real option.
//
// So it renders, and the script surface is closed by the response headers
// instead (see serveSibling):
//
//   - Through an <img>, which is how a document's figure is displayed,
//     scripts in an SVG DO NOT RUN AT ALL. That is a browser rule, not a
//     galley policy, and it covers the case that matters.
//   - Navigated to directly — the one way a script could run — the response
//     carries "Content-Security-Policy: sandbox", which loads it into an
//     opaque origin. A script inside it is then not same-origin with galley
//     and cannot reach the mutating endpoints with the browser's cookie,
//     which is the only thing worth protecting here (see guard).
//
// The residual risk is a hostile SVG in a directory the user chose to edit a
// document in, viewed directly, in a browser that ignores CSP sandbox. That
// is a narrower exposure than the file simply not loading is a cost.
//
// Keys are lower-case; the lookup folds the request's extension to match, so
// IMG_0001.JPG off a phone is served like any other figure.
//
// It is render.ImageTypes, so the figures the editor shows are the ones the
// rendered page embeds.
