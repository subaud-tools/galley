// versions.go cuts rounds, serves their history, and can copy one back into the
// working draft without rewriting the record.
//
// COMMIT ON SEND is the one rule, and every cut in this file is a send: a
// Revise press hands the round to the agent, the agent's return hands it back,
// the wake a live settle fires sends without a press, and a verdict is the
// round the review ended on. Both modes use one mechanism — live simply sends
// more often.
//
// A SAVE IS NOT A SEND, and the difference is the whole of "a version is a
// round, not every save". Live mode used to cut on any projection whose digest
// had moved, so a reviewer typing prose committed a full copy of the document
// per export debounce while sending nothing to anybody. The live cut hangs off
// the notifier's own decision to wake the agent now — see EditServer.wakeSettle
// — which is the thing that actually sends, and which prose does not move.
//
// WHERE THE CUT HAPPENS IS THE WHOLE OF THE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT. While a round
// is open the browser's CRDT is the live state and the file is a projection, so
// "the document at this instant" is a question only the projection can answer
// without tearing. So NOTHING HERE READS THE DOCUMENT TO MAKE A VERSION: a send
// RECORDS AN INTENT and then asks for a projection, and `project` — already
// holding the mutation mutex, already holding the exact bytes it is about to
// write to the author's file — is what cuts the version. A version is therefore
// always, byte for byte, a projection output. It can never be half a keystroke
// ahead of the .md, and it can never be what the agent did not read.
//
// (One function here does read the document, and it is not making a version:
// reviewerInstruction reads the open threads for the reviewer's own words, off
// the press path and the wake path, before mu is taken. It is a read of the
// CONVERSATION, not of the prose, and what it returns is recorded beside a
// version rather than becoming one.)
//
// A VERSION THAT COULD NOT BE WRITTEN MAY NOT FAIL A ROUND. This is the
// ledger's rule and it applies here for the same reason: the record is memory,
// and a read-only checkout, a full disk or a permissions error must not turn a
// Revise press into an error page. A failed cut is logged and the round goes on.

//
// IT IS READ OFF THE THREADS, the live state pending.json mirrors, and it is
// SAID ONCE.
//
// AN INSTRUCTION BELONGS TO THE ROUND THAT CARRIED IT. Phase 1 recorded the
// outstanding conversation on every round, and stated the consequence rather
// than hiding it: an instruction the agent had not discharged was recorded on
// the next round too. PHASE 2 MAKES THAT WORSE RATHER THAN THE SAME, and that is
// why it is fixed here. A revision DISCHARGES an instruction — the thing it
// asked for happened — so nothing resolves the thread any more, and every later
// round in a session would repeat the same words forever: measured in a browser,
// `v4 · revise` carried `spell this out — it reads as a code identifier` for a
// second time, three rounds after the agent had already done it. A history whose
// every entry is paired with the same instruction is a history with no pairing.
//
// SO THE WORDS ARE MARKED AS SAID ONLY WHEN THE ROUND THAT CARRIES THEM IS
// ACTUALLY CUT. reviewerInstruction hands back a `mark` the caller runs after
// requestCut returns a real round number, for the reason requestCut drops an
// intent that outlived its projection: a version that could not be written may
// not fail a round, and it may not take the reviewer's words out of the NEXT one
// either.
