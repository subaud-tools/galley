// guard is what every mutating endpoint runs before it does anything. It

//
// THE THREAT IS AN ORDINARY WEB PAGE. galley listens on 127.0.0.1 with no
// authentication — by design, it is the user's own machine — so any page the
// user has open in the same browser can send it requests, and the browser will
// attach nothing that identifies the sender. Before this guard existed, a
// cross-origin POST rewrote the user's document, and a cross-origin POST to
// /_galley/revise made the server run its configured command through `sh -c`.
// Both were verified. No fetch and no CORS cooperation is needed for that: a
// plain auto-submitting <form> is a "simple request", exempt from preflight,
// and the attacker never has to read the response to have done the damage.
//
// Two checks here, with localweb's token in front of every route:
//
//   - POST ONLY, and the Allow header says exactly that. The previous code
//     also accepted PUT while advertising "Allow: POST"; a method the 405
//     denies existed is a method nothing is testing.
//   - CONTENT-TYPE MUST BE application/json. A cross-site form can only spell
//     text/plain, application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data.
//     Requiring anything else forces an attacker onto fetch/XHR, which needs a
//     preflight this server never answers. This is the load-bearing half.
//   - THE TOKEN IS NOT CHECKED HERE. Every route is behind localweb's, which
//     refuses a cookie sent with another Origin. A client with the token in the
//     header (the CLI) sends no Origin at all.

	// nothing, and there was no error anywhere to look at. That is the same
	// silence `pending.suggestions` -> `pending.instructions` cost weeks over,
	// pointing the other way.
