// ReviewerChange is one thing the reviewer changed in the document BY HAND,
// as distinct from an instruction they wrote about it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, measured rather than supposed. On 2026-08-22 a reviewer
// deleted a section in round 3 and the agent's round 4 put it back inside an
// 8k expansion. The version history proves the deletion worked: the section is
// absent from v3, the round the reviewer sent, and present again in v4, the
// agent's landing. The agent had no way to know — the round notification it
// received carried only instructions, and closed by telling it not to read
// `galley pending`.
//
// AND THE TRAIL IT WOULD HAVE READ THERE DOES NOT EXIST. `PendingView` had no
// changes field; the `/_galley/trail` route the browser's own
// `SerializedTrailEntry` type documents is in no Go file; and `trailChanges`
// is a doc comment with no function under it. The reviewer's hand edits were
// published to nothing, so this is not "the notification omits what pending
// has" — nothing had it.
//
// COMPUTED FROM TWO VERSIONS, NEVER FROM THE BROWSER'S GHOSTS. The trail in
// `web/trail.ts` deliberately REFUSES to place a ghost it cannot anchor
// unambiguously — correct for anchoring, where a wrong mark is worse than a
// missing one, and fatal here, because a refused ghost would be an unreported
// deletion. A document diff cannot refuse. It also makes the reviewer's side
// symmetric with the agent's, where the contract already says galley owns the
// computed list and the agent's entries only annotate it.

	// Key ADDRESSES ONE CHANGE, and it is derived from content rather than

	// renumber the moment an earlier edit was reverted — this repository's
	// oldest rule, and the card holding a stale one would revert the wrong
	// passage. Two identical changes are genuinely one thing to this key, and
	// reverting either is the same act.
	//

	// would be a field nobody reads.

// there were rather than silently stopping — a truncation nobody is told about
// reads as "that is all of them", which is the failure this repository records

// ledger's reason: a read-only checkout must not turn a Revise press into an

// IT FILTERS RATHER THAN DEDUPES, and the difference is not cosmetic.

// The first cut of this file deduped identical entries, on the reading that a
// deleted paragraph produced two indistinguishable delete ops. They are
// distinguishable — the second carries `Absorbed` — and I had not looked.
// Worse, the dedupe was WRONG IN A WAY THE FILTER IS NOT: a document with two
// identical paragraphs in different places, both deleted, is two removals, and
// collapsing them under-reports the reviewer's own edits to the agent. That is
// the exact harm this file exists to prevent, reintroduced by a workaround for
// a misreading of it.
//
// ONE CHANGE PER BLOCK, NOT PER REGION. A coalesced region can carry two
// neighbouring blocks: when the matcher lines the removed block's boundary up
// with the kept block's below it, the run opens on a sentence and the next
// block's boundary is the first `coalesceBlocks` meets, so it absorbs the
// whole of the second block. Reporting the region's head alone told the agent
// of the first removed paragraph and never the second (galley#56), the very
// deletion it then writes back. The region stays one for the painted diff,
// whose counts are pinned; here each further block among its members is
