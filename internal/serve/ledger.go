// ledger.go is edit mode's memory: every decision this server reaches, written
// to the repository's committed decision log at the moment it is reached.
//
// THE LEDGER IS MEMORY, NEVER TRUTH, and this file is where that stops being a
// slogan. Review state stays exactly where it was — the .md and the unsent round —
// and nothing here is on the path that puts it there. The whole surface is
// EditServer.remember, which returns nothing: there is no error for a handler
// to check, so no handler can be written to refuse a send because a disk was
// full. internal/ledger.Recorder does the rest (bounded queue, its own
// goroutine, a recover around the append), and its TestRecorderSwallowsAFailed
// Append and TestRecorderSwallowsAPanickingAppend hold that.
//
// LATENCY: THE DECISION PATH PAYS A CHANNEL SEND AND NOTHING ELSE. The append
// is a file write — a repo-root walk, a MkdirAll, a .gitattributes check and an
// O_APPEND write — and on a network mount or a wedged disk that is unbounded.
// None of it happens here. What happens here is building a small struct and
// handing it to a buffered channel, which is why remember can be called from
// inside a handler that has just sent a forty-instruction round without the
// reviewer waiting on forty file writes. The trade is stated in
// Recorder: a process that exits without flushing loses whatever is queued.
// `galley edit`'s shutdown and the CLI's exit both flush.
//
// EVERY RECORD IS TAKEN BEFORE THE MUTATION AND WRITTEN AFTER IT. Before,
// because a Pending is meaningful only against the model it was listed from —
// the ordinal-identity rule CLAUDE.md states. After, because a transform that
// runs and then fails to apply decided nothing, and a ledger that recorded it
// would be remembering something that never happened.
