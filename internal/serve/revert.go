// REVERTING ONE EDIT IS NOT UNDO, AND THAT IS WHY IT EXISTS.
//
// ⌘Z is SEQUENTIAL: it walks back through what you did, most recent first.
// This is TARGETED — put back the paragraph I deleted three edits ago and keep
// the two I made after it — which is what Word's Reject and Docs' suggestion
// controls do, and what undo cannot do at any price.
//
// The user, on the card needing a press: "what if the edit card did have something
// to press… isn't this how most editors work?" It is, and the one part that
// does not transfer is accept/reject: in those tools a change is a PROPOSAL
// awaiting somebody's decision, and here the edit is the reviewer's own and
// already applied. Nobody is being asked. So there is one verb, and it is this.
//
// IT WORKS IN BLOCKS OF SOURCE, NOT IN A RENDERED MODEL, and that is what keeps
// it from being a second markdown writer. `diff.Blocks` splits a document into
// blocks whose `Text` is the RAW SOURCE — "# A careful review", "- one" — so a
// document is rebuilt by joining them, exactly as it was written. Reconstructing
// from `docmodel` instead would mean re-rendering, and this repository has one
// renderer on purpose.
//
// IT REFUSES WHAT IT CANNOT DO EXACTLY. A revert that lands the words in a
// plausible-but-wrong place is worse than a button that says no: the reviewer
// would have to notice, and the whole point of the verb is that they should not
// have to hold the document in their head. Three shapes are handled and
// anything else is refused by name.
//
// IT REBUILDS FROM THE MARKED DOCUMENT, and finds its blocks through `clean`.
// The change was found by comparing documents with every instruction mark
// lifted (see plainText), so `before` and the change's words are clean; the
// document it writes back is `afterMarked`, the live serialization with every
// `{==…==}{>>@comment …<<}` and every ID note still in it. Rebuilding from the
// clean side put the paragraph back and took every instruction's place with
// it. `clean` is applied one block at a time, to find a block by what it says;
// the block written back is always its marked source.
