// WriteFileAtomic writes raw to path through a temp file and a rename, so a
// reader never observes a half-written document — and without changing what
// the file IS.
//
// The plain form of this gets two things wrong on a file the user already
// owns. A temp file is created 0600, so renaming it over a document the user
// had made group- or world-readable silently locks it down. And a rename onto
// a SYMLINK replaces the link with a regular file, detaching a document that
// was deliberately reached through one — a doc symlinked into a notes tree
// becomes two divergent files.
//
// So: resolve the path first and write through the link, and carry the
// existing file's permission bits onto the replacement. A file that does not
// exist yet is created 0644 (before umask), the ordinary default for a
// document rather than the private default of a temp file.
//
// One residual, deliberately: a rename detaches path from its inode, so a
// HARD link to the same document keeps the old content under its other name.
// Preserving that would mean truncating and rewriting in place, which gives up
// the atomicity this function exists for. A torn document is worse.
