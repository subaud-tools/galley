// ONE AUTHORED EDIT IS ONE SPAN.
//
// The companion clause to CLAUDE.md's "one span in the file is one decision
// everywhere". That rule defends the file -> cards direction; these tests
// defend intent -> file, which is where the corruption came from: a target of
// plain prose crossing a code span was applied one inline at a time against a
// live document, so one authored edit arrived as three independently decidable
// cards, and three individually reasonable decisions put a word neither side
// wrote on disk.
//
// Every test here mints runs, because MINTING IS WHAT MADE IT LIVE-ONLY.
// Offline no run is ever minted, every token is "", List's grouping key
// matches on emptiness and the pieces collapse by accident. A test that skips
// MintRuns passes against the bug.
