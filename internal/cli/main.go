const about = `^ galley — review before the one-way door.

The READING commands speak --json — pending, wait, round and ledger —
and that is where the machine-readable surface is; this line used to
claim every command did, and most did not.

pending goes through a running server when there is one, and falls back to the
file. The agent's revision is the file itself: edit the .md, then 'galley ack'.
revise has no offline form — it wakes whoever is
listening, a 'galley wait' session or --on-revise's command, and without a
server there is nothing to hand it to.

galley pushes and pulls. Push wakes someone who is not here:
  galley edit doc.md --on-revise '<shell command>'

Pull is for the agent session that already IS here, holding the branch and the
discussion — it waits on the document instead of being spawned fresh:
  galley wait doc.md

Pull is the better loop and should be the default. When there is no session in
the room, push can spawn one — with the document and nothing else — and
'galley agent-prompt' is the text that tells it what to do:
  galley edit doc.md --on-revise 'claude -p "$(galley agent-prompt doc.md)"'

The channel is pull, packaged: it starts with the session, attaches to every
editor this session opens — and any unowned one under its root — and delivers
each Revise, settle and Approve into the session as an event. No listener to
remember. In Claude Code it comes from galley's plugin; install it once, then
start claude as usual:
  claude plugin marketplace add subaud-tools/galley
  claude plugin install galley@galley

In pi, the channels.tools extension runs 'galley channel'. See
plugin/README.md.

'galley render doc.md' writes the document's branded HTML page without an
editor, the same page Share HTML writes.

Run 'galley <command> -h' for a command's flags.
