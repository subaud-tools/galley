// wake.go is THE ONE PLACE A WAKE MEANS SOMETHING.
//
// Two carriers speak this protocol and they used to spell it twice. `galley
// wait` is the PULL half (see wait.go's header, and the README, which calls it
// the loop to reach for first); the channel's notifications are the PUSH half.
// Both have to answer the same two questions about every wake — what happened,
// and is the review over — and for one wake they answered differently.
//
// THE TRUST EXIT IS AN APPROVE THAT IS NOT AN ENDING. "✓ Accept all & approve"
// sweeps, seals, and hands the reviewer's surviving notes to the agent; the
// review is closed to the REVIEWER and stays open to the AGENT until that work
// lands (seal.go's handoff section is the whole argument). #72 taught the push
// carrier that — `approveContent` branches on the thread count — and the pull
// carrier was never told. Measured against the shipped binary at fc2319d, with
// the server holding `verdict: approved-entrusted, entrusted: 2, outstanding:
// 2`, a parked `galley wait` printed:
//
//	the reviewer approved hand.md as it stands — the review is over; do not re-arm
//
// Both halves false. `galley suggest` was still accepted against that document
// and `galley ack --state answered` still refused it as unfinished — the
// handoff was open, and the one loop the docs promote told the agent to stop.
//
// So the BRANCH and the WORDS live here and both carriers render through them.
// Not "agree by hand": this repository's own repeated lesson is that two sites
// spelling one rule is the shape just before the gap (CLAUDE.md, "six agreeing
// spellings and one silence"), and a carrier fixed while its twin is forgotten
// is how this arrived.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SHARED: `revise` and `chat`. Those two sentences
// name their own carrier's next verb — the channel's says `galley_ack`, an MCP
// tool a shell loop cannot call, and the CLI's is the re-arm pointer wait.go
// prints — and there is nothing about the REVIEW's meaning in either to
// disagree about. The four ENDINGS are where the meaning lives, and where the
// disagreement was.

// measured facts about the same server: after a trust press with two threads
// surviving, `galley suggest` was accepted and `galley ack --state answered`

// could not be trusted to be 0. That count reads Pending.Decidable now (see

// goneContent is the sentence for the ending nobody chose. It is terminal like
