// THE ROUND HANDS OVER ITS KEYS, AND FOR THE WHOLE OF PHASE 3 IT DID NOT.
//
// The MCP contract tells the agent to name in its ack's `answers` "which
// instruction it answers BY THE KEY THE ROUND HANDED YOU". `instructionPayload`
// carried Text, Quote and At — no key — so every CLI surface that renders a
// round (`galley pending`, `galley wait --json`, the channel notification)
// handed over no key, and compliance was structurally impossible.
//
// Measured against a real review on 2026-08-22: the paired agent sent `quote`
// and `note` on all 23 changes across three landed rounds and `answers` on none
// of them. Every change card then rendered with no ask beside it, and the asks
// piled onto the round card instead — two symptoms of one absent field.
//
// Nothing failed loudly because a JSON decoder ignores what it is not asked
// for: the server has always sent `key` on `instructionView`, and this side
// simply did not decode it. These checks are the ones that would have said so.

// TestTheLiveWireCarriesTheKeyIntoTheCLI decodes the server's own instruction
// shape into the CLI's and requires the key to survive.
//
// It is written against the JSON rather than against the Go types on purpose:
// `instructionView` is unexported in internal/serve, and the wire between them
// IS the json, which is the thing that was silently dropping a field.
