// decodes straight into this, and the offline path builds one from a plain
// parse, so callers never see a different shape depending on where the data
// came from.
// instructionPayload and pendingPayload ARE the server's own types, aliased.
//
// They used to be hand-written near-copies, and the copy is what cost us: the
// CLI's instruction struct carried Text, Quote and At and NO KEY, while
// `serve.InstructionView` had carried `key` all along. Both carriers told the
// agent to answer "by the key the round handed you" and the round handed over
// none, so a paired agent sent `answers` on none of 23 changes across three
// rounds — it had nothing to answer with. Nothing failed loudly because a JSON
// decoder ignores what it is not asked for, and no test compared the two
// shapes.
//
// AN ALIAS CANNOT DISAGREE WITH ITSELF, which is the whole point. These are
// the same types the server marshals and the same types `web/wire.d.ts` is
// generated from, so a field added, renamed or removed on the server reaches
// every CLI surface and the browser in one move — and `just verify` fails on
// drift rather than a reviewer noticing months later.
//
// The CLI reads only some of these fields. That is fine and is not a reason to
// keep a narrower copy: the cost of the copy was never the unused fields, it
// was the one field nobody noticed was missing.

// work is already happening, which is what asking for a revision wanted. So
// `galley revise` printed "a revision is already in flight", returned nil, and
// exited 0 — for EVERY 409.
//
// The seal (#69) added a second, opposite one. `refuseSealed` answers 409 for a
// review that has ENDED: there is no next round to ask for and nothing was
// woken. Read as the first, it printed a reassuring sentence over a refusal and
// exited 0 — measured on a sealed fixture, and left as a comment at a

// spellings and one silence" with a string literal for a spelling: the seal's
// sentence would be pinned in two repositories' worth of places and the next
// 409 anyone adds would be silently misread again, exactly as this one was. GET
// /_galley/revise already publishes `sealed` and `running` — the same server,
// answering the same question it just answered with the status code — so the
// CLI asks it.
//
