// wait.go is galley's PULL half.
//
// Every other hook here pushes: --on-revise and --on-settle run a shell command
// to wake someone who is not here. That is right for a persistent agent with an
// inbox and wrong for paired review, where the valuable participant is the
// session that is ALREADY here — holding the branch, the discussion and the
// hours of context that made the review worth having. `galley wait` inverts it:
// that session blocks on the document and is woken when the reviewer asks.
//
// TRANSPORT: LONG-POLL, NOT SERVER-SENT EVENTS.
//
// `galley wait` asks one question once and answers it with an exit code. A
// long-poll is exactly that shape — one request, one response, no protocol
// beyond HTTP, and it works through anything that speaks it. SSE is the better
// fit for a consumer that stays open and takes a stream of events, which is
// precisely what the editor's websocket already is; adding a second streaming
// channel for a client whose whole life is one answer would buy nothing and
// cost a framing format, a reconnect policy and a parser.
//
// The one thing a long-poll needs that a stream does not is a way to survive
// its own expiry, because a poll held open forever is indistinguishable from a
// wedged one. That is what --since and the `timeout` reason are for: each
// expiry reports the fingerprint the server is CURRENTLY at, and the next poll
// re-arms on it. Nothing falls into the gap between two polls, because the gap
// is exactly what a stale --since detects.
//
// WHAT THE CURSOR CANNOT DETECT IS AN ENDING, and it never could: a clean
// approve decides nothing and moves no fingerprint, so a poll armed on a
// perfectly current cursor blocked through the verdict and reported `timeout`
// over a review that was already over. The seal is a FACT the server holds
// rather than an event it fired, so any poll of an ended review is answered
// with its ending — with or without a cursor, moved fingerprint or not. That
// is why this command exits on approve and discard and tells the caller not to
// re-arm: coming back would be told the same ending again, correctly.
//
// KNOWN CAVEAT FOR ANYONE WRITING A LOOP AROUND THIS: --since goes stale if
// YOU write between two waits.
//
// The printed fingerprint is the document as it stood when this command
// returned. If the loop then answers the review — edits the file, acks the
// round — the document moves, and the cursor in hand no longer
// describes it. Passing it back as --since is then a stale cursor, and the next
// wait catches up IMMEDIATELY on the loop's own work.
//
// It costs one wasted iteration, and then the loop settles. It is not a missed
// wake, and a waiter that is ALREADY BLOCKED is not affected at all — the
// server's self-wake guard covers that case, and there is a test for it. It
// only bites the arm-work-arm shape.
//
// WHAT THE WASTED ITERATION ACTUALLY CARRIES, because an earlier draft of this
// comment got it wrong and a loop written against that sentence would size its
// catch-up handling wrong. It said the agent is "shown only suggestions it
// wrote itself". It is not. A wake carries the WHOLE pending view — every open
// suggestion and every thread, the reviewer's included — because Pending is a
// SNAPSHOT and never a delta. What is wasted about the iteration is only what
// PROVOKED it: the loop's own writes moved the fingerprint past the cursor in
// hand, and nothing the reviewer did is new. Measured on a green `just loop`:
// four entries, two the agent's and two the reviewer's, on a wake nobody asked
// for. A loop that reads a wake as "here is what is new" will re-process work
// it has already answered, every round. Diff against what you last saw.
//
// Two ways around it, neither requiring anything from galley: drop --since on
// the arm that follows your own writes and accept the small race, or do the
// writing before the wait rather than between two of them. The real fix is for
// the mutating verbs to print the fingerprint the way this one does, so a
// loop's cursor is never stale; that is a change to those commands, not to
// this one.

// and the server does not keep why. It used to answer `settle` there, which
// says the document settled in ● live mode — a claim, and one that is simply
