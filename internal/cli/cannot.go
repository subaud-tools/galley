// cannot.go is THE EXCEPTION, and it is a REPORT rather than a turn in a
// conversation.
//
// An instruction is discharged by the revision itself, so there is nothing to
// resolve and nothing to reply to. What is left is the one case with no
// revision. It is a ROUND — visible where every other round is visible, in the
// history, paired with the instruction it could not answer — and NOT an ack:
// `failed` is a status about a press, and this is a report about an
// instruction whose only answer is a different instruction.
//
// The agent's WRITE surface is the .md file itself (see the handoff in
// internal/serve); this file carries the one verb that has no revision.
