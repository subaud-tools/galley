// open.go is galley_open: the channel starting an editor for its own session.
//
// THE CHANNEL IS THE SESSION'S PRESENCE INSIDE GALLEY, so it is the one
// process that knows, with certainty and without reading an environment
// variable, which session a new editor belongs to. Before this tool the agent
// ran `galley edit` from its shell and the editor stamped whatever session id
// that shell carried — which under pi, after an in-process subagent had run,
// was the subagent's (measured 2026-09-08). The channel then refused the
// editor as another session's, correctly, and the reviewer typed into a
// document nobody was attached to. Spec: session identity at spawn.
