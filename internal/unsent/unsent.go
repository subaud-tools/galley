// Package unsent owns the unsent round: the reviewer's comments that have not
// been sent to the agent yet, kept in `pending.json` beside the document's
// rounds (`<doc dir>/.galley/versions/<doc>/pending.json`).
//
// It is the ONE place a comment's words live. The .md carries only an ID mark
// at the comment's place — `{==words==}{>>@comment cm-…<<}` after highlighted
// text, `{>>@comment cb-…<<}` on its own line after a block, and nothing at all
// for a whole-document comment — and galley links a comment to its place by
// that ID alone. Words in the file were what forced every match on text, and
// every match on text was a way to pair a comment with the wrong place.
//
// The file is written BEFORE the .md on every add, edit and delete, so an ID
// mark in the .md always has its comment here. The reverse is allowed: a
// comment with no mark (galley stopped between the two writes) is shown as
// unplaced, never lost.
//
// # Policy
//
// PRIVATE, in internal/ondisk's terms. The file is scratch state written and
// read back by one running galley, in a gitignored directory, and the caller
// already has a quarantine path for a file it cannot read. So an unknown key
// is refused (ErrUnreadable) and a newer `v` is refused (ondisk.ErrFuture):
// misreading half a round costs the reviewer's words or their attribution,
// and a newer file must be left untouched rather than overwritten.
