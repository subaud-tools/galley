// Package markdown parses the supported markdown subset into galley's
// docmodel document tree. It never silently mangles a construct it doesn't

// directive blocks and "> [!NOTE]" callouts all error, naming the construct and
// the source line. GFM tables are supported (phase 1e) and convert to the
// table/tableRow/tableCell tree docmodel and TipTap share.
//
// TWO CONSTRUCTS ARE CARRIED VERBATIM RATHER THAN MODELLED OR REFUSED, and the
// discriminator between carrying and refusing is whose language the CONTENT is
// in. YAML and TOML front matter (docmodel.FrontMatter, frontmatter.go) and
// "$$" display math (docmodel.MathBlock, math.go) are not markdown: there is no
// prose inside either to review, no mark to hang on one and nothing galley
// could be right or wrong about, so it models that the block is THERE and
// models nothing about what is inside it. The three dialects refused above all
// hold ordinary markdown prose, and carrying THAT verbatim would keep the bytes
// while making the author's own sentences unreviewable — see dialects.go.
//
// Front matter was the construct that was neither modelled nor refused, and so
// the one that was destroyed by being opened; the four line-break dialects were
// the same failure found again a phase later.

//
// Element tags in the shared fragment are TipTap's (CLAUDE.md), so a node this
// package writes has to satisfy TipTap's CONTENT rule as well as carry its
// name. Two rules markdown can violate without writing anything unusual:
//
//   - listItem is `paragraph block*` — STRICTER than block+. The first child
//     must be a paragraph, and goldmark hands back whatever the item's first
//     line was: a fence, indented code, a heading, a blockquote, a nested list,
//     a table, an image, a rule, a note — or nothing at all, for a bare "-".
//   - blockquote is `block+`. A bare ">" is a Blockquote with no children.
//
// y-prosemirror does not skip a node it cannot build. createNodeFromYElement
// calls schema.node, which is createChecked and THROWS, and the catch deletes
// el._item out of the Y doc; the deletion broadcasts, EditServer's OnUpdate
// fires, touch() schedules Project(), and the author's file is rewritten with
// NO KEYSTROKE. Measured on the tracked build, opening this and touching
// nothing:
//
//  1. ```sh                 1. done
//     brew install galley
//     ```              ->
//  2. ```sh
//     galley edit doc.md
//     ```
//  3. done
//
// Two steps and both commands gone, and the survivor RENUMBERED 3 -> 1, so the
// file reads as a complete one-step procedure. And it cascades: an emptied
// bulletList fails `listItem+` next, and a blockquote holding only that list
// fails `block+` after it, so "> - ```sh ./deploy --now ``` " left nothing.
//
// THE ROUND-TRIP OBJECTION IS NOT REAL HERE EITHER, and that is the part to
// keep — it is the same objection tableRow's comment records being wrong about
// a blank cell, and #63 recorded it as REAL for a list item without measuring
// it. An empty Paragraph renders to nothing, renderedBlocks DROPS a block that
// renders to nothing, and a list marker and a blockquote's ">" are written
// whether or not the body renders anything. So "- x" is spelled "- x" with or
// without the leading empty paragraph, a bare "-" is still "-", and a bare ">"
// is still ">": Serialize is byte-identical on every input, which is asserted
// over the whole corpus rather than argued (TestLegalizeChangesNoBytes), and
// Parse(Serialize(Parse(x))) == Parse(x) is untouched.
//
// It belongs here and NOT in ydoc for tableRow's reason: a bridge that
// synthesised the paragraph would make Parse and ydoc.Read two different models
// of one file, and every round-trip property both layers rest on is stated over
