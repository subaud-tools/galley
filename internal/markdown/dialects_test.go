// TestTheLineBreakDialectsAreNeverReflowed is the check the four measured
// defects were found without.
//
// FOUR DIALECTS, ONE BUG: each is a plain paragraph to CommonMark, and the
// converter turns a soft line break into a space. That is deliberate for prose
// and it destroys these. Run red against the tracked build — with math.go and
// dialects.go deleted — every row reports the reflowed one-liner in `got`, from
// `Serialize(Parse(src))` alone, which is what a `galley suggest` or a
// projection writes to the author's file.
//
// The claim is the BYTES, not the tree: a construct that reads back byte for
// byte is one nothing has happened to, and a construct that refuses has not
// been written over. There is no third acceptable outcome, and "one line where
// there were four" is the second one this table exists to fail on.
