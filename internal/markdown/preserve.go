// SerializeOnto writes d as markdown, KEEPING THE AUTHOR'S OWN BYTES for every
// top-level block that has not changed.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Serialize renders the document model, and the model does not
// carry spelling: a setext heading comes back "# h", "* item" comes back "-
// item", "__bold__" comes back "**bold**", and a paragraph hard-wrapped over
// three lines comes back on one, because Parse turns a soft line break into a
// space. None of that is a change anybody made. Measured 2026-08-22 on a real
// document: opening it in the editor and quitting without touching a key
// rewrote six separate things, because cmd/galley's shutdown Flush projects
// unconditionally and a projection is Serialize's output.
//
// The paper-over was to skip the write when nothing changed. That leaves the
// harm exactly where the reviewer actually meets it — fix one typo in a
// forty-paragraph post and the other thirty-nine are reformatted around it, in
// the same commit, and the diff no longer says what was done.
//
// THE RULE IS SELF-VERIFYING, WHICH IS WHY IT NEEDS NO ALIGNMENT ARGUMENT.
// prev is chopped into the source of each of its top-level blocks; a chunk is
// KEPT as a candidate only if parsing that chunk on its own yields exactly one
// block, and the candidate is only USED for a block whose rendering is byte-
// identical to the rendering of the chunk's own reparse. So a substituted chunk
// provably reparses to the block it replaced. Nothing here has to reason about
// how Parse's block list lines up with goldmark's children — through
// splitNoteLines, legalize and extractCritic, all three of which can change the
// count — because no index is ever carried across.
//
// IT IS TOP-LEVEL ONLY, and that is a floor rather than a limit: a list whose
// third item was edited re-renders whole, because the candidate for the list no
// longer matches. Recursing into containers is a later change; it cannot make
// this one wrong, only tighter.
//
// The rendering used as the key is renderedBlocks' own, taken from the SAME
// call that produces the output, so a list's marker style (which is decided by
// its neighbours and not by the block) is part of the key. A block that renders
// differently because of where it sits simply misses its candidate and is
// written the serializer's way — the safe direction, and the only one that
// cannot invent bytes.
//
// A chunk is consumed when it is used, so two identical paragraphs take two
// different chunks, in order, and never the same one twice.
