// FuzzRoundTrip is the round-trip property test. It asserts the TRUE
// properties of Parse/Serialize, which are weaker than the obvious ones and
// were established the hard way across Tasks 3 and 4 — asserting the
// obvious ones instead just produces a corpus full of known classes and
// hides whatever real bug is underneath them.
//
// What is NOT asserted, and why:
//
//   - "Serialize is a fixed point on the first write" is false. Markdown
//     has no escape for CriticMarkup, so marker characters that survive one
//     write as literal text can be read as SYNTAX on the next one. The
//     document still SETTLES, it just takes another round — see
//     TestSerialize_LiteralMarkerText_Convergence in critic_test.go. Its two
//     cases now settle on the FIRST write (the per-span run stopped adjacent
//     spans fusing, which is what used to splice marker characters together),
//     but the class is not provably gone, so the harness still grants rounds.
//     Property (a) below is the true, weaker statement.
//
//   - "docmodel.Equal(d1, d2)" is false in two documented ways: mark ORDER
//     within an Inline is not canonicalized ({++a{--b--}c++} reads back
//     [Ins, Del] and writes a form that reads back [Del, Ins]), and
//     suggestion Attrs (author, at) have nowhere to live in the file at all
//     (the Attrs half is pinned by critic_test.go's
//     TestSerialize_DifferentAuthorsStayDistinctSpans; the mark-order half is
//     not pinned anywhere). The bytes still settle. What
//     must never happen is the AUTHOR'S WORDS going missing, which is what
//     property (b) checks instead — and checks more strictly than tree
//     equality would, because it survives every legitimate normalization.
//
//   - "text is preserved exactly" is false: collapsing a literal-marker
//     document can drop the punctuation between two markers. Property (b)
//     compares LETTERS AND DIGITS only, which is the line between "this
//     round trip lost some syntax it never had a spelling for" and "this
//     round trip ate a word".
//
// The three properties:
//
//	(a) the round trip CONVERGES to a byte-fixed point within three
//	    serializations;
//	(b) from the first serialization onward, every letter and digit is
//	    either still in the next serialization or was lifted into a
//	    comment on the way;
//	(c) every intermediate output reparses without error. No exemptions:
//	    "Serialize wrote a construct Parse refuses" is a file that will not
//	    load, and no shape of that is worth tolerating;
//	(d) every block's KIND survives the first serialization, with a
//	    paragraph written after it: the reparse holds the same blocks, in
//	    the same order, and then that paragraph. See blockKindsSurvive.
//
// Two further known classes, both pre-existing and both out of scope for
// this task, are tolerated by MOVING property (a)'s deadline rather than by
// dropping it: emphasis delimiters that CommonMark does not pair back the
// way the renderer emitted them, and CriticMarkup markers that survive one
// write as text and are read as syntax on the next. Both unwind one layer
// per round, so both buy rounds rather than exemptions. See slowRounds.

// Property (b) starts at the FIRST serialization, not at the source,
// because Parse-then-Serialize legitimately renumbers: a document starting
// "10. x" is an ordered list whose marker Serialize rewrites as "1.", and
// that is canonicalization, not loss. Everything after the first write is
// already canonical, so from there on nothing may go missing.
