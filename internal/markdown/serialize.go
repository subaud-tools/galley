// fences, "**bold**"/"*italic*"/"***both***" emphasis, "[text](href)"
// links, "![alt](src)" images, a trailing "\" for hard breaks, a blank line
// between sibling blocks (except inside a list item, which is tight), and
// exactly one trailing newline.
// A FRONT MATTER BLOCK IS COPIED, NOT RENDERED, and it is hoisted out of the
// block loop rather than given a case in renderBlock. Two reasons, and both are
// about bytes:
//
//   - it is the author's metadata verbatim, delimiters and all (see
//     docmodel.FrontMatter), so the only correct rendering is the one that
//     writes it back unchanged; and
//   - it is the one block whose separator is not the loop's. renderBlocksLoose
//     joins with a blank line, which is right here too — but the block already
//     ends in its own newline, so it would be written with two.

// with no keystroke. The closer need not even be another rule: a "---" inside a
// code fence is a line like any other to a scanner that walks lines.

// leading rules, nothing between them). This covers the rest, and it asks the
// question of the BYTES rather than reasoning about which documents can reach
// it — the reasoning is what left the fence case out of the first draft.
//
// "***" is the other spelling of a thematic break, and swapping the marker
// costs three bytes in a document that was going to be misread. The leading
// newline is the backstop for anything else that could open a block (a
// hand-built paragraph spelling "+++", which Parse cannot produce): markdown

// pair would be written flush and read back MERGED, with the second list's
// items renumbered into the first. Alternating the style whenever a list
