// Package versions is where a document's rounds are kept.
//
// A VERSION IS A ROUND, AND A VERSION IS THE FILE — byte for byte the same
// projection output that reached the author's .md, which is what bounds what
// one can ever hold. What changed between any two of them is COMPUTED by
// internal/diff and NEVER WRITTEN DOWN, because a stored diff is a second copy
// of a fact that can disagree with the documents it came from. That half is
// unconditional: no rendered diff reaches this directory in any phase.
//
// "EVERY VERSION IS A CLEAN DOCUMENT" IS THE CALLER'S RULE, NOT THIS
// PACKAGE'S. The agent's changes are applied rather than proposed, and the edit
// server lifts the unsent comments' marks (suggest.ClearInstructions) before
// the seed and before a send cuts its version. But a version equals the
// projection, and a suggestion mark read from a hand-written file —
// `{--**bold**--}{++brave++}` — is still in the projection. Nothing here strips
// it: a version that differed from the file would be a version of a document
// nobody has.
//
// # Where they live, and why
//
// Beside the document, in `<dir>/.galley/versions/<document>/`: `0001.md`,
// `0002.md`, … one clean markdown file per round, plus `rounds.jsonl`, one JSON
// line per round carrying who moved it, when, why it was cut, and the
// instruction that produced it.
//
// FULL COPIES, NOT DIFFS, and not de-duplicated either. A version is a few KB;
// a reference to another version is not a document, and the moment one round's
// content is expressed in terms of another's, "every version is a clean
// document" stops being true of the thing on disk.
//
// Three homes were considered and two were declined.
//
// THE LEDGER was declined for the CONTENT and is where the process record
// eventually belongs. `.galley/decisions.jsonl` is committed and merged with
// `merge=union`, so a rebase replay or a cherry-pick legitimately keeps both
// sides' lines — a mechanism that is exactly right for short decision records
// and exactly wrong for multi-kilobyte document bodies, which it would duplicate
// wholesale. The ledger also lives at the REPO ROOT, found by walking up for
// `.git`, so a document edited outside a repository has no ledger at all: the
// recording surface has no error to hand back, by design, and a round that
// vanished silently would break the one promise the history makes, which is
// that it is complete.
//
// GIT was declined because a running galley owns the FILE and owns nothing
// else. Cutting a version mid-round would mean writing to the reviewer's index
// and their history — during a rebase, in a dirty tree, in a directory that may
// not be a repository at all — which is a side effect galley has no licence to
// take. Git also has nowhere to put the instruction that produced a round
// without inventing a trailer convention, and the pairing of a round with its
// instruction is the whole reason the history is worth keeping.
//
// BESIDE THE DOCUMENT, so moving a document's directory takes its versions
// with it. In a repository whose documents sit at the root — the
// common case, and this repository's own — that path is literally
// `.galley/versions/<doc>/<n>.md`.
//
// AND IT IS GITIGNORED, which is what "the history is insurance" means when the
// insurance is full copies. `galley edit` starts writing here the moment it
// opens a document, so committed by default a live hour's forty rounds of
// somebody's draft arrive in their next pull request. The ledger's opposite
// ruling is not a precedent for this one: `.galley/decisions.jsonl` is ONE LINE
// per decision and is deliberately shared. Everything here is nevertheless
// built to be committed the day a team decides it wants to — standalone files,
// an append-only manifest, and the `merge=union` attribute written into the
// directory on the first commit — so un-ignoring `**/.galley/versions/` is the
// whole of that change. See the spec's "the history is insurance, not a
// feature".
