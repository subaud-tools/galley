# Changelog

Newest first. Notes for releases up to 0.10.2 are on the GitHub releases page: https://github.com/subaud-tools/galley/releases

## Unreleased

- Pressing Revise again after a Revise got no reply sends its instructions again. Before, the agent was woken with no instructions. With new instructions on the page, Revise sends those as before.

## 0.16.0

- The page shows where each Revise stands, in a pill beside the button: sent, with the agent, working (with the agent's line), answered, declined, failed or no reply. The harness reports when a Revise lands in the agent's session and when the agent's turn ends: under Claude Code the plugin runs the new `galley report`, under pi the channel takes them from channels.tools.
- `galley cannot` shows as failed, with the agent's reason as the line.
- `galley_ack` and `galley ack` no longer take `received`; they take working, answered, declined or failed. An ack the Revise's state does not allow (answered after declined) is refused with the reason.
- A restart mid-revision keeps where the Revise stood: the handoff lease is now version 2. An older galley that meets one keeps it as `handoff.json.unreadable` and starts without resuming.
- Cancelling a handoff clears the pill, as Approve does.
- The built-in `galley login` and `logout` come with tools-common v0.26.0.
- galley now uses tools-common v0.27.0.

## 0.15.6

- Enter in a comment box comes from tools-common v0.25.0's page kit (`enter.js`, copied into the bundle like the Share menu): Enter files, Shift-Enter breaks the line, as before. The Share menu is unchanged.

## 0.15.5

- Two galley pages on different ports can stay signed in in the same browser: the sign-in cookie is named per port (tools-common v0.22.0).

## 0.15.4

- `galley help` tells you to turn on auto-update for the galley marketplace in Claude Code, so the plugin stays current.
- The Share menu and its clipboard come from tools-common v0.19.0 (`localweb.PutFile` and the page kit's `share.js`), built into galley's own bundle. It looks and works as before; Escape now closes it too.

## 0.15.3

- The Claude Code plugin's mod is now a thin shim: `galley watch` decides what each event says and whether a session hears it, so later fixes arrive with the binary.

## 0.15.2

- In a pi session on the claude-bridge, events arrive once instead of twice: the Claude Code plugin's mod stays quiet there.

## 0.15.1

- `galley help` says to install the Claude Code plugin and no longer prints the `--dangerously-load-development-channels` launch flag.

## 0.15.0

- **Claude Code hears galley without a launch flag.** Install the galley plugin and a session started with plain `claude` gets each Revise as a turn: the plugin's mod runs the new `galley watch` for the session. No `--dangerously-load-development-channels` and no warning dialog at launch.
- `galley watch` prints each event as one JSON line, for the plugin's mod.
- Under Claude Code, `galley channel` serves galley's tools only and leaves rounds to `galley watch`; under pi it works as before.

## 0.14.0

- Module path is now github.com/subaud-tools/galley; the source lives at github.com/subaud-tools/galley.

## 0.13.2

- **An edit made to the document outside the editor is saved as a version.** History lists it as "changed outside the editor", and it no longer counts as your own edit, so you can approve the document without pressing Revise first. (#82)
- Agents treat an instruction as guidance and write the change in the document's own voice, instead of copying your words into the text. (#82)

## 0.13.1

- **The + Instruction button is gone from the bar.** Click anywhere on empty space in the right-hand panel to write an instruction about the whole document, or right-click anywhere below the bar with nothing selected. Selecting words still shows the instruction button beside them, and right-clicking a selection now shows your browser's own menu. (#78)
- **Asking the agent to open a document opens its page every time,** and a document whose review has ended comes back as a fresh review in one step. Before, you sometimes got only a link, and reopening an approved review needed its old editor stopped by hand. (#81)

Fixed:

- An agent that answered a round right after saving its edits was sometimes told nothing had changed, and had to answer again. galley now waits a moment for the save to land. (#77)

## 0.13.0

- **Share an approved document.** After you approve a review, the Revise button becomes **Share**. **Download HTML** and **Download Markdown** save the document to your Downloads folder. On macOS, **Share HTML** and **Share Markdown** put the file on your clipboard, so pasting into Slack or an email attaches it. The HTML is one file that opens offline, with the document's sections in a sidebar, its diagrams drawn, and images that sit next to the document included. (#74)
- **HTML preview.** A button in the bar opens that same page in a new tab while you edit a Markdown document. It reloads after every save. (#74)
- **Themes.** A theme sets the page's colours, fonts and logo. Put one in `~/.config/galley/themes/<name>/` and name it in a project's `.galley/config.json`. With no theme, documents get galley's own page. See https://galley.tools/themes/. (#74)
- **`galley render doc.md`** writes the shared HTML page without opening a review, and prints the error instead when a theme has a problem. (#74)
- **Approve from the conversation.** Telling the agent you approve ends the review the same way the page's Approve button does, and the open page locks itself. (#73)
- After approval the bar says only **Approved** and the time, and the notice in the lower left goes away. Text that appears in the bar no longer moves what is already there. (#73, #74)

## 0.12.3

- An agent can review a document outside the folder its session started in. Before, galley refused it, so agents reviewed a copy instead. (#68)

## 0.12.2

- Starting a review from an agent session opens the page in your browser. Before, you had to copy the address from the agent. (#63)

## 0.12.1

- **An open review no longer writes over a change made to the file outside the editor.** Before, galley wrote its own copy over the file whenever it saved, so an agent's edit to the open document was lost without a word, and a document moved away was written back at its old path. Now galley checks the file before every save. If only the file changed, the review loads it. If you and someone else changed it at the same moment, your copy is kept and the other version is saved in `.galley/recovery/`. A document that is no longer at its path is never written; the review says so, and anything you type meanwhile is saved in `.galley/recovery/` when the editor stops. (#44)
- A notice under the bar says when a document was moved away, changed at the same moment as your edits, or changed into something galley can't read.
- Opening and closing a document you didn't edit leaves the file exactly as it was.

Fixed:

- `galley edit` no longer crashes on a `$$` math block after a tab inside a list and a quotation. (#54)

## 0.12.0

- **One button for every block, always visible.** Every top-level heading, code block, table, image, diagram, display-math block and front-matter block now has one square button in the left margin, level with its first line. A block nested inside a list or a quotation has none. It shows without hovering, and Tab reaches it from the keyboard after the document. Pressing it opens the instruction box on that block straight away, outlines what the instruction covers (a heading's whole section, or the block), and leaves your selection alone.
- **Tables, display math and front matter can take an instruction.** Before, the page offered no way to instruct a whole table. A table's card is headed with its column names (`on table: key, value`) instead of a line of markdown.
- **A figure's region is reached from its button.** Pressing an image's or diagram's button opens an instruction on the whole figure, and **Mark a region** in that box lets you drag a rectangle to narrow it to part of the picture.
- A block that already carries instructions shows how many on its button (`1`, `2`, up to `9+`).
- Selecting inside a top-level table, fence, equation or front matter now says you can press the button to its left to instruct the whole block.
- The button is small and faint until you point at it or tab to it, or until it shows a count. A heading's section is outlined as one region, from the heading to the section's last block.
- **An instruction box opens directly beneath its block or selection.** If there is not room for it there, the page scrolls just far enough instead of the box being placed somewhere else; it goes above only for words near the bottom of the window. As you type, it grows only into the room the window has.
- **A click off an empty instruction box closes it.** A box with something typed in it stays open until you send it or cancel.
- The buttons are hidden, and cannot be pressed, after approval, while the agent holds the document, in History and in a page's HTML view.
- **Removed:** the `§` button that appeared beside a heading on hover, the `{}` button beside a code block, and the `⊕ comment on a region` button on a figure. The one block button replaces all three.

Fixed:

- The **Add instruction** button sits next to the selection again. In 0.11.0 it could land at the foot of the window, far from the words.
- A new instruction on a block was briefly listed without its place, so for a moment it could show as unplaced.
- Pressing Enter in a block's box before galley had seen the block filed an instruction on nothing. It now does nothing until the block is known, and the box can be sent, with what you typed kept, as soon as galley sees the block.

## 0.11.0

Every comment is now stored the same way, whatever it is on: selected text (including a selection across paragraphs), a section, a block, a figure or a rectangle on one, a table cell, a code block, or the whole document.

- **Comments survive a galley restart.** Until you press Revise, every comment's words are kept in `.galley/versions/<doc>/pending.json`, which is written before the `.md` on every add, edit and delete. Stopping galley, or a crash, loses none of them: the next `galley edit` of the same `.md`, or of the same `page.html` while the page has not changed outside galley, puts each one back in place. One whose place is gone, including every comment on a `page.html` that was edited outside galley in between, shows as unplaced instead of being lost. Revise sends them as the round and empties the file.
- `galley edit` refuses to start on a `pending.json` written by a newer galley, and leaves it untouched. An unreadable `pending.json` is moved aside to `pending.json.unreadable` and galley starts with no unsent comments.
- **The `.md` carries only ID marks.** While a comment is unsent, the file holds a short mark at its place and never its words: `{>>@comment cm-…<<}` after the highlighted words, a `{>>@comment cb-…<<}` line after a block, and nothing for a whole-document comment. galley links a comment to its place by that ID alone, never by matching words. Revise removes the marks, so versions stay clean.
- **Line breaks work in every comment.** A comment on a section, block or figure may now hold line breaks and blank lines; galley used to refuse them. Every comment box keeps them (Enter files, Shift-Enter breaks a line, including when editing a card), every card shows them, and they reach the agent, `galley round`, `galley pending`, the decision log and History.
- The three comment boxes (on a selection, on the whole document, and a card's edit box) share one size and one behaviour.
- **`galley serve` and `galley comments` are removed**, together with the `<page>.comments.json` file and the in-page review client they used. Review an HTML page with `galley edit page.html`.
- **A hand-typed `{>>note<<}` is no longer imported as a comment.** One inside a sentence is dropped from the file at the next save. One on a line of its own is shown but never sent, and is removed when you press Revise.
- A comment with no words, or on a selection with no words in it, is refused.
- Deleting all the words a comment on selected text was about takes the comment back; undo brings it back. A taken-back comment stays taken back across a page reload and a restart, and is never sent.

**Upgrade note:** send a review in progress on 0.10.4 (press Revise) before upgrading. Its unsent comments on selected text are not carried over, and its old section comments become notes that are shown but never sent.

Developer note: the `just wasm`, `wasm-exec` and `serve` recipes are gone.

Fixed:

- Comments on selected text, and the rectangles on figure comments, were lost if galley stopped before Revise.
- Editing a section comment to add a line break wrote the comment into the document as ordinary prose.
- Changing a word inside a highlighted passage hid its comment from the rail.
- Revert on a hand edit removed every pending comment mark from the document. It now restores only the words that changed and leaves every comment mark in place.
- The reviewer's list and the agent's list were built by two different functions and could disagree about which instructions existed. One builder now serves the rail, `galley wait`, `galley pending` and the round.
- `galley pending`, run with no editor open, left out comments on selected text.
- The whole-document comment box turned line breaks into spaces before sending, and no card showed line breaks.
- Page mode's check for whether the page changed did not ignore comment marks, although it said it did.
- When page mode reloaded the editor because `page.html` was edited by hand, unsent comments went with the replaced document. They are now kept, shown as unplaced, and sent with the round.
- An edit to a comment that had been sent or deleted in the meantime was lost. The words now move to the whole-document box, with the reason, so you can file them again.
- After a section or code-block grip's comment was sent or cancelled, the grip's selection stayed, and the next keystroke replaced the whole section.
- A code block's comment left the caret inside the read-only fence.
- The comment box was placed for the height it opened at, so as it grew it ran off a short window or down over the passage.
- Sending a round could remove a table cell, or a whole blockquote, whose only content was a note.
- Restarting `galley edit page.html` put every unsent comment back unplaced, because the page's prose was extracted afresh from `page.html`, which carries no comment marks. The prose galley kept is now reused while the page has not changed outside galley.
- `galley pending page.html`, run with no editor open, read the page instead of the prose and unsent comments galley keeps for it.

## 0.10.4

- The channel no longer prints a line for a document another live session owns. That refusal is the ownership rule working, but the pi channels harness shows channel stderr as a notification, so sessions under an overlapping scope announced each other's reviews and it read like cross-session bleed. The reason is still in `galley_channel_status`; a review whose owning session has ended is still announced.

## 0.10.3

- Releases are built through the family release actions (tools-actions); the assets, signing and `/dl` paths are unchanged.
- Checked by the family lint set (tools-actions v0.6.0), which replaces galley's own `.golangci.yml`. The findings are fixed (dead loop-variable copies, response bodies closed in tests, a switch for an if-chain, two unused parameters and results) or carry their reason inline. No behaviour change.
- `just verify` is the family push gate: `prepare` (the wasm client), the family Go gate at the version CI pins, and `verify-extra` (the TypeScript gate and the committed editor bundle). The pre-push hook and CI run exactly this. The browser gates are `just verify-slow`, and `just verify-all` runs everything; CI still requires the gates job.
- The pre-commit hook checks formatting instead of rewriting files. Run `just hooks` once per clone.
